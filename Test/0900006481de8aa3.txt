    SUMMARY: We are adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain 
    Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) Model S-76A, S-76B, and S-76C 
    helicopters. This AD requires inspecting the main gearbox (MGB) lower 
    housing jet bores for leaks, paint or caulk blistering, and liner 
    protrusion. This AD was prompted by several reports of MGB low oil 
    pressure warnings which were determined to be the result of unsecured 
    jet bore liners that had protruded. The actions are intended to prevent 
    failure of the MGB from loss of oil, which could result in subsequent 
    loss of control of the helicopter.

        The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by 
    reference of a certain document listed in this AD as of February 9, 
    2016.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    
    Discussion
    
        On June 2, 2014, at 79 FR 31231, the Federal Register published our 
    notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), which proposed to amend 14 CFR 
    part 39 by adding an AD that would apply to Sikorsky Model S-76A, S-
    76B, and S-76C helicopters with a MGB installed that has undergone 
    certain repairs. The NPRM proposed to require, within 50 hours time-in-
    service (TIS), inspecting the MGB for leaks, paint or caulk blistering, 
    and liner protrusion. If there is oil leakage or protrusion of a jet 
    bore liner, the NPRM proposed to require replacing the MGB before 
    further flight. The NPRM also proposed to require, within 1,500 hours 
    TIS, replacing the MGB with an MGB that was not subject to the 
    applicability of the NPRM unless it had been repaired in accordance 
    with a later overhaul and repair procedure.
        The NPRM was prompted by four reports of protruding jet bore liners 
    on Sikorsky S-76 helicopters with a MGB, part number (P/N) 76351-09000 
    series, 76351-09500 series, and 76351-09600 series. During an overhaul 
    of the MGB, the jet bore liner retaining pins were not adequately 
    drilled into the liner, allowing the jet bore liner to move in the 
    housing, because the overhaul and repair instruction (ORI) did not 
    adequately describe procedures and housing wall thickness limitations 
    for installing the retaining pins. Movement of the jet bore liner into 
    the housing allows oil to leak between the liner and the housing, 
    possibly resulting in loss of oil in the MGB, which could result in 
    failure of the MGB and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.
        At the time we issued the NPRM, we understood these repairs had 
    been made in accordance with Sikorsky ORI No. 76350-065, Revisions A 
    through E. However, the incident MGBs had only been repaired in 
    accordance with Sikorsky ORI No. 76350-065, Revision A or earlier. 
    Sikorsky ORI 76350-065, Revisions B through F, resolve the unsafe 
    condition by clarifying the retaining pin installation instructions. 
    This AD now reflects that clarification.
    
    Comments
    
        After our NPRM (79 FR 31231, June 2, 2014) was published, we 
    received comments from one commenter.
    
    Request
    
        Sikorsky stated the proposed requirement to overhaul the affected 
    MGBs within 1,500 hours TIS is overly conservative because the daily 
    visual inspection is adequate to ensure safety until the next overhaul 
    period. Sikorsky further commented that the 1,500 hour compliance time 
    would be burdensome to operators and not cost effective. When asked for 
    additional information to support this comment, Sikorsky stated that 
    its maintenance program has a major inspection, and not a MGB overhaul, 
    every 1,500 hours. The major inspection does not require removal of the 
    MGB. Overhaul of the MGB for Model S76A helicopters occurs every 3,250 
    hours and for Model S76B/C helicopters occurs every 3,750 hours.
        We agree. We intended the proposed requirement to provide a 
    terminating action that coincides with overhaul of the MGB. We 
    incorrectly understood the 1,500-hour major inspection involved 
    removing the MGB from the helicopter. We agree that due to the gradual 
    loss of oil, safety is maintained with the repetitive inspections until 
    the MGB is replaced or overhauled when specified in the maintenance 
    program. We have revised paragraph (e)(2) of this AD to require 
    replacement of the MGB ``within 3,750 hours TIS'' instead of ``within 
    1,500 hours TIS.''
        Sikorsky also commented that limiting acceptable repairs to those 
    performed in accordance with Sikorksy ORI 76350-065 Revision F was 
    unnecessary because Revision B and subsequent revisions provide 
    installation details that are structurally equivalent to Revision F. 
    When asked for additional information to support this comment, Sikorsky 
    stated the changes in Revision B clarified the pin retention 
    instructions sufficiently to resolve the oil leakage issue. Although 
    Revision F provides for the installation of an additional pin, Sikorsky 
    stated that this is not a significant change. Sikorsky confirmed that 
    all reports of oil leakage involved repairs using the procedures in 
    Revision A or earlier.
        We agree. We reexamined Sikorsky ORI No. 76350-065 and its 
    revisions and found Revisions B through F structurally equivalent with 
    only minor changes and improvements. We have changed paragraphs (a) and 
    (e) of this AD to reference the appropriate revisions of Sikorsky ORI 
    No. 76350-065.
    
    FAA's Determination
    
        We have reviewed the relevant information, considered the comments 
    received, and determined that an unsafe condition exists and is likely 
    to exist or develop on other products of these same type designs and 
    that air safety and the public interest require adopting the AD 
    requirements as proposed with the changes described previously. These 
    changes are consistent with the intent of the proposals in the NPRM (79 
    FR 31231, June 2, 2014), and will not increase the economic burden on 
    any operator nor increase the scope of this AD.
    
    Related Service Information Under 1 CFR Part 51
    
        Sikorsky issued Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) 76-66-50, Basic Issue, 
    dated January 14, 2013 (ASB 76-66-50) for Model S-76A, S-76B, and S-76C 
    helicopters with an MGB P/N 76351-09000 series, 76351-09500 series, and 
    76351-09600 series, which have been repaired in accordance with ORI No. 
    76350-065 or ORI No. 76350-065, Revision A. ASB 76-66-50 describes 
    procedures for inspecting each MGB lower housing jet bore for leaking 
    oil, paint or caulk blistering, and liner protrusion. If there is any 
    liner protrusion or leaking oil between the
    
    [[Page 149]]
    
    liner and the housing, the ASB requires replacing the MGB. If there is 
    paint or caulk blistering, the ASB requires further inspecting for 
    leaking oil by replacing the jet bore packing, performing a ground run 
    of the main rotor for 30 minutes, and re-inspecting the jet bore for 
    leaking oil.
        This information is reasonably available because the interested 
    parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
    the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.
    
    Other Related Service Information
    
        We also reviewed Sikorsky ORI No. 76350-065, Revision B, dated June 
    10, 2011; Revision C, dated June 27, 2011; Revision D, dated January 
    20, 2012; Revision E, dated January 27, 2012; and Revision F, dated May 
    10, 2012. This service information describes procedures for repairing 
    the retaining ring groove areas of the MGB jet bores and installing 
    retaining pins in the jet bore liners.
    
    Differences Between This AD and the Service Information
    
        The ASB specifies compliance by a specific calendar date, while the 
    compliance time in this AD is in hours TIS. The ASB does not specify a 
    terminating action for the recurring inspections of the MGB jet bores; 
    while this AD does specify a terminating action for the recurring 
    inspections.
    
    Costs of Compliance
    
        We estimate that this AD affects 53 helicopters of U.S. Registry. 
    We estimate that operators may incur the following costs in order to 
    comply with this AD. At an average labor rate of $85 per work-hour, 
    inspecting the jet bore liners requires about 1.1 work-hours, for a 
    cost per helicopter of $94 and a total cost to US operators of $4,982 
    per inspection cycle. If required, repairing a jet bore liner requires 
    about 14 work-hours, and required parts cost $200, for a cost per 
    helicopter of $1,390. If required, replacing the MGB requires about 134 
    work-hours, and required parts cost $994,000, for a cost per helicopter 
    of $1,005,390.
    
    Authority for This Rulemaking
    
        Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
    issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
    authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
    describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
        We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
    Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: ``General 
    requirements.'' Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with 
    promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
    regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator 
    finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within 
    the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition 
    that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this 
    rulemaking action.
    
    Regulatory Findings
    
        This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
    13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
    on the relationship between the national government and the States, or 
    on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various 
    levels of government.
        For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
        (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
    Order 12866;
        (2) Is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
    Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979);
        (3) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska to the extent 
    that it justifies making a regulatory distinction; and
        (4) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
    negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
    of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
        We prepared an economic evaluation of the estimated costs to comply 
    with this AD and placed it in the AD docket.

        This AD becomes effective February 9, 2016.
    
    (d) Compliance
    
        You are responsible for performing each action required by this 
    AD within the specified compliance time unless it has already been 
    accomplished prior to that time.
    
    (e) Required Actions
    
        (1) Within 50 hours time-in-service (TIS), and thereafter at 
    intervals not to exceed 6 hours TIS, inspect each MGB lower housing 
    jet bore (jet bore), as depicted in Figures 3 and 4 of Sikorsky S-76 
    Alert Service Bulletin 76-66-50, Basic Issue, dated January 14, 2013 
    (ASB 76-66-50), for liner protrusion or movement, paint or caulk 
    blistering, or oil leakage.
        (i) If there is any liner protrusion or movement, before further 
    flight, replace the MGB with an MGB that has not been repaired in 
    accordance with ORI 76350-065 or ORI 76350-065A, unless it has been 
    subsequently repaired in accordance with Sikorsky ORI No. 76350-065, 
    Revision B, dated June 10, 2011 (ORI 76350-065B); Sikorsky ORI No. 
    76350-065, Revision C, dated June 27, 2011 (ORI 76350-065C); 
    Sikorsky ORI No. 76350-065, Revision D, dated January 20, 2012 (ORI

    F, dated May 10, 2012 (ORI 76350-065F).
        (ii) If there is any oil leakage or paint or caulk blistering, 
    inspect the jet bore for liner protrusion and perform a leakage 
    check by following the Accomplishment Instructions, Paragraphs 
    3.C.(1) through 3.C.(6)(a), of ASB 76-66-50.
        (iii) If any moisture or droplets of MGB oil are visible on a 
    jet bore after accomplishing the leakage check specified in 
    paragraph 3.C.(6)(a) of ASB 76-66-50, repeat paragraphs 3.C(4) 
    through 3.C(6) of ASB 76-66-50. If any moisture or droplets of MGB 
    oil are still visible, before further flight, replace the MGB with 
    an MGB that has not been repaired in accordance with ORI 76350-065 
    or ORI 76350-065A, unless it has been subsequently repaired in 
    accordance with ORI 76350-065B, ORI 76350-065C, ORI 76350-065D, ORI 
    76350-065E, or ORI 76350-065F.
