    Background
    
        On November 24, 2015, the Coast Guard published a final rule that 
    amends the ballast water management reporting and recordkeeping 
    requirements. 80 FR 73105. The final rule delayed the effective date of 
    33 CFR 151.2060(b) through (f) and Sec.  151.2070 because these 
    sections contain collection-of-information provisions that require 
    approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the 
    Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. On December 4, 
    2015, the OMB approved the collection assigned OMB Control Number 1625-
    0069, Ballast Water Management for Vessels with Ballast Tanks Entering 
    U.S. Waters. Accordingly, we announce that 33 CFR 151.2060(b) through 
    (f) and 151.2070 are effective February 22, 2016. The approval for this 
    collection of information expires on December 31, 2018.
        This document is issued under the authority of 33 U.S.C. 1231.
    
        Dated: December 30, 2015.
    J.G. Lantz,
    Director of Commercial Regulations and Standards, U.S. Coast Guard.
