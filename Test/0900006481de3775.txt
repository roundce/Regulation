    Certifications and Exemptions Under the International Regulations 
    for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972
    
    AGENCY: Department of the Navy, DoD.
    
    ACTION: Final rule.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The Department of the Navy (DoN) is amending its 
    certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for 
    Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, as amended (72 COLREGS), to reflect 
    that the Deputy Assistant Judge Advocate General (DAJAG)(Admiralty and 
    Maritime Law) has determined that USS ZUMWALT (DDG 1000) is a vessel of 
    the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot 
    fully comply with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without 
    interfering with its special function as a naval ship. The intended 
    effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS 
    apply.
    
    DATES: This rule is effective January 4, 2016 and is applicable 
    beginning November 18, 2015.
    
    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Commander Theron R. Korsak, (Admiralty 
    and Maritime Law), Office of the Judge Advocate General, Department of 
    the Navy, 1322 Patterson Ave. SE., Suite 3000, Washington Navy Yard, DC 
    20374-5066, telephone 202-685-5040.
    
    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 
    U.S.C. 1605, the DoN amends 32 CFR part 706.
        This amendment provides notice that the DAJAG (Admiralty and 
    Maritime Law), under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy, 
    has certified that USS ZUMWALT (DDG 1000) is a vessel of the Navy 
    which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot fully comply 
    with the following specific provisions of 72 COLREGS without 
    interfering with its special function as a naval ship: Annex I 
    paragraph 2 (a)(i), pertaining to the location of the forward masthead 
    light at a height not less than 6 meters above the hull; Annex I, 
    paragraph 2(g) pertaining to the placement of sidelights above the hull 
    of the vessel; Annex I, paragraph 2(i)(iii), pertaining to the equally 
    spaced vertical separation of three task lights; and Annex I, paragraph 
    2(k) as described in Rule 30 (a)(i), pertaining to the vertical 
    separation between anchor lights, and the location of the forward 
    anchor light at a height of not less than 6 meters above the hull; 
    Annex I, paragraph 3(a), pertaining to the location of the forward
    
    [[Page 9]]
    
    masthead light in the forward quarter of the ship, and the horizontal 
    distance between the forward and after masthead lights; Annex I, 
    paragraph 3(c), pertaining to the task lights placed at a horizontal 
    distance of not less than 2 meters from the fore and aft centerline of 
    the vessel. The DAJAG (Admiralty and Maritime Law) has also certified 
    that the lights involved are located in closest possible compliance 
    with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements.
        Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR parts 
    296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for public comment 
    prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public 
    interest since it is based on technical findings that the placement of 
    lights on this vessel in a manner differently from that prescribed 
    herein will adversely affect the vessel's ability to perform its 
    military functions.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ On DDG 1000, the ship does not have a traditional mast. To achieve
      the effect of a ``single, all-around light,'' multiple sets of task
      lights are embedded into each of the four faces of the ship's
      superstructure. Except when viewing the ship from dead ahead, dead
      astern or broadside, two deckhouse surfaces are visible; consequently,
      two sets of task lights are visible simultaneously. Because the
      deckhouse surfaces are sloped, unless the lights are viewed dead-on,
      the three task lights do not present as being in a vertical line.
