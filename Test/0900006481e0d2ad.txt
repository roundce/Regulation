    SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), finalize a 
    rule under authority of section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 
    1973 (Act), as amended, that provides measures that are necessary and 
    advisable to provide for the conservation of the northern long-eared 
    bat (Myotis septentrionalis), a bat species that occurs in 37 States, 
    the District of Columbia, and 13 Canadian Provinces.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    
    Executive Summary
    
        The need for the regulatory action and how the action will meet 
    that need: Consistent with section 4(d) of the Act, this final 4(d) 
    rule provides measures that are tailored to our current understanding 
    of the conservation needs of the northern long-eared bat.
        On April 2, 2015, we published a document that is both a final rule 
    to list the northern long-eared bat as a threatened species and an an 
    interim 4(d) rule to provide measures that are necessary and advisable 
    to provide for the conservation of the northern long-eared bat. At that 
    time, we opened a 90-day public comment period on the interim rule, and 
    we committed to publish a final 4(d) rule by December 31, 2015, and to 
    complete review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act 
    (NEPA). Previously, on January 16, 2015, we published a proposed 4(d) 
    rule with a 60-day public comment period. Therefore,we have had two 
    comment periods totaling 150 days on two versions of the 4(d) rule.
        Statement of legal authority for the regulatory action: Under 
    section 4(d) of the Act, the Secretary of the Interior has discretion 
    to issue such regulations she deems necessary and advisable to provide 
    for the conservation of the species. The Secretary also has the 
    discretion to prohibit by regulation, with respect to a threatened 
    species, any act prohibited by section 9(a)(1) of the Act.
        Summary of the major provisions of the regulatory action: This 
    final species-specific 4(d) rule prohibits purposeful take of northern 
    long-eared bats throughout the species' range, except in instances of 
    removal of northern long-eared bats from human structures, defense of 
    human life (including public health monitoring), removal of hazardous 
    trees for protection of human life and property, and authorized capture 
    and handling of northern long-eared bats by individuals permitted to 
    conduct these same activities for other
    
    [[Page 1901]]
    
    bats until May 3, 2016. After May 3, 2016, individuals who wish to 
    capture and handle northern long-eared bats for recovery purposes will 
    need a permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Act.
        Incidental take resulting from otherwise lawful activities will not 
    be prohibited in areas not yet affected by white-nose syndrome (WNS). 
    WNS is a fungal disease affecting many hibernating U.S. bat species. 
    Ninety- to one-hundred-percent mortality has been seen in bats affected 
    by the disease in the eastern United States.
        Take of northern long-eared bats in their hibernacula (which 
    includes caves, mines, and other locations where bats hibernate in 
    winter) is prohibited in areas affected by WNS, unless permitted under 
    section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Act. Take of northern long-eared bats inside 
    of hibernacula may include disturbing or disrupting hibernating 
    individuals when they are present as well as the physical or other 
    alteration of the hibernaculum's entrance or environment when bats are 
    not present if the result of the activity will impair essential 
    behavioral patterns, including sheltering northern long-eared bats.
        For northern long-eared bats outside of hibernacula, we have 
    established separate prohibitions from take for activities involving 
    tree removal and activities that do not involve tree removal. 
    Incidental take of northern long-eared bats outside of hibernacula 
    resulting from activities other than tree removal is not prohibited. 
    Incidental take resulting from tree removal is prohibited if it: (1) 
    Occurs within a 0.25 mile (0.4 kilometer) radius of known northern 
    long-eared bat hibernacula; or (2) cuts or destroys known occupied 
    maternity roost trees, or any other trees within a 150-foot (45-meter) 
    radius from the known maternity tree during the pup season (June 1 
    through July 31). Incidental take of northern long-eared bats as a 
    result of the removal of hazardous trees for the protection of human 
    life and property is also not prohibited.
        Peer review and public comment: We sought comments on our proposed 
    4(d) rule from independent specialists to ensure that this rule is 
    based on scientifically sound data, assumptions, and analyses. We also 
    considered all comments and information we received during the comment 
    periods on the proposed and interim 4(d) rules.
    
    Previous Federal Actions
    
        Please refer to the proposed (78 FR 61046; October 2, 2013) and 
    final (80 FR17974; April 2, 2015) listing rules for the northern long-
    eared bat for a detailed description of previous Federal actions 
    concerning this species. On January 16, 2015, we published a proposed 
    4(d) rule (80 FR 2371) for the northern long-eared bat and on April 2, 
    2015, we published an interim 4(d) rule (80 FR 17974) for this species.
    
    Background
    
        The northern long-eared bat is a wide-ranging species that is found 
    in a variety of forested habitats in summer and hibernates in caves, 
    mines, and other locations in winter. WNS is the main threat to this 
    species and has caused a precipitous decline in bat numbers (in many 
    cases, 90-100 percent) where the disease has occurred. Declines in the 
    numbers of northern long-eared bats are expected to continue as WNS 
    extends across the species' range. For more information on the northern 
    long-eared bat, its habitat, and WNS, please refer to the October 2, 
    2013, proposed listing (78 FR 61046) and the April 2, 2015, final 
    listing (80 FR 17974) rules.
        The Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) does not specify particular 
    prohibitions, or exceptions to those prohibitions, for threatened 
    species. Instead, under section 4(d) of the Act, the Secretary of the 
    Interior has the discretion to issue such regulations as she deems 
    necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of such 
    species. The Secretary also has the discretion to prohibit by 
    regulation, with respect to any threatened wildlife species, any act 
    prohibited under section 9(a)(1) of the Act with respect to endangered 
    species. Exercising this discretion under section 4(d) of the Act, the 
    Service developed general prohibitions (50 CFR 17.31) and exceptions to 
    those prohibitions (50 CFR 17.32) under the Act that apply to most 
    threatened wildlife species.
        In addition, for threatened species, under the authority of section 
    4(d) of the Act, the Service may develop prohibitions and exceptions 
    that are tailored to the specific conservation needs of the species. In 
    such cases, some of the prohibitions and authorizations under 50 CFR 
    17.31 and 17.32 may be appropriate for the species and be incorporated 
    into a separate, species-specific, rule under section 4(d) of the Act. 
    These rules will also include provisions that are tailored to the 
    specific conservation needs of the threatened species and may be more 
    or less restrictive than the general provisions at 50 CFR 17.31.
    
    Definitions
    
        This final rule uses several definitions and provisions contained 
    in the Act and its implementing regulations.
        The Act and its implementing regulations (50 CFR part 17) define 
    take as harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture 
    or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.
        The term ``harass'' (50 CFR 17.3) means an intentional or negligent 
    act or omission which creates the likelihood of injury to wildlife by 
    annoying it to such an extent as to significantly disrupt normal 
    behavioral patterns which include, but are not limited to, breeding, 
    feeding, or sheltering.
        The term ``harm'' (50 CFR 17.3) means an act which actually kills 
    or injures wildlife. Such act may include significant habitat 
    modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife 
    by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including 
    breeding, feeding or sheltering.
        ``Purposeful take'' includes the capture and handling of individual 
    bats. Take in this manner includes both capture and handling to remove 
    bats from human structures and take that is for research purposes 
    (e.g., attaching a radiotracking device). Other purposeful take would 
    include intentional removal of bats from hibernacula or the intentional 
    killing or harassing of bats under any circumstance.
        ``Human structures'' are defined as houses, garages, barns, sheds, 
    and other buildings designed for human entry.
        ``Incidental take'' is defined at 50 CFR 17.3 as any taking 
    otherwise prohibited, if such taking is incidental to, and not the 
    purpose of, an otherwise lawful activity. Examples of incidental take 
    (or non-purposeful take as it is sometimes referred to in this rule) 
    include land-management actions, such as implementation of forestry 
    practices, where bats may be harmed, harassed, or killed as a result of 
    those otherwise lawful actions. The actions contemplated in this rule 
    include a wide range of actions for purposes such as right-of-way 
    development and maintenance, forestry, land use for development 
    unrelated to wildlife management, management of lands as habitats other 
    than bat habitat (e.g., prairie), energy production and transmission, 
    and other activities.
        Incidental take within the context of this rule is regulated in 
    distinct and separate manners relative to the geographic location of 
    the activity in question. For the purposes of this rule, we have 
    developed a map associated with the occurrence and spread of WNS. This 
    map will be updated by the first of each month as the disease spreads 
    throughout the range of the species and
    
    [[Page 1902]]
    
    posted at <http://www.fws.gov/midwest/Endangered>.
        ``Known hibernacula'' are defined as locations where northern long-
    eared bats have been detected during hibernation or at the entrance 
    during fall swarming or spring emergence.
        ``Known, occupied maternity roost trees'' are defined as trees that 
    have had female northern long-eared bats or juvenile bats tracked to 
    them or the presence of females or juveniles is known as a result of 
    other methods.
        ``Tree removal'' is defined as cutting down, harvesting, 
    destroying, trimming, or manipulating in any other way the trees, 
    saplings, snags, or any other form of woody vegetation likely to be 
    used by northern long-eared bats.
    
    WNS Zone
    
        The WNS zone, as mapped, provides the boundary for the distinction 
    of implementation of this rule. To estimate the area impacted by WNS, 
    we have used data on the presence of the fungus causing the disease, 
    called Pseudogymnoascus destructans, or Pd, or evidence of the presence 
    of the disease (WNS) in the bats within a hibernaculum. Our final 
    listing determination provides additional information concerning Pd and 
    WNS (80 FR 17993; April 2, 2015). Confirmed evidence of infection at a 
    location within a county is mapped as a positive detection for the 
    entire county. In addition, we have added a 150-mile (241-kilometer 
    (km)) buffer to the Pd-positive county line to account for the spread 
    of the fungus from one year to the next. In instances where the 150-
    mile (241-km) buffer line bisects a county, the entire county is 
    included in the WNS zone.
        Over the past 5 years, an average of 96 percent of the new Pd or 
    WNS counties in any single year were within 150 miles (241 km) of a 
    county that was Pd- or WNS-positive in a prior year (Service 2015, 
    unpublished data). Pd is generally present for a year or two before 
    symptoms of WNS appear and mortality of bats begins to occur. Given the 
    relatively short amount of time between detection and population-level 
    impacts, it is important that we protect those buffer areas and the 
    bats within them with the same regulations as those in known WNS 
    positive counties. Therefore, the positive counties, plus a buffer 
    around them, are the basis for the WNS zone map.
    
    Summary Comparison of the Interim 4(d) Rule and This Final Rule
    
        Based on information we received in comment periods on the proposed 
    and interim 4(d) rules (see Summary of Comments and Recommendations 
    below), we revised the provisions of the interim 4(d) rule to better 
    reflect the disproportionate effect that the disease, WNS, has had and 
    will continue to have, we believe, on northern long-eared bat 
    populations.
        In the interim rule, we used the term ``white-nose syndrome buffer 
    zone'' to identify ``the portion of the range of the northern long-
    eared bat'' within 150 miles (241 km) of the boundaries of U.S. 
    counties or Canadian districts where the fungus Pseudogymnoascus 
    destructans (Pd) or WNS had been detected. For purposes of 
    clarification, in this final rule, we have changed the term ``white-
    nose syndrome buffer zone'' to ``white-nose syndrome zone'' or ``WNS 
    zone.'' And we state that the ``WNS zone'' is ``the set of counties 
    within the range of the northern long-eared bat'' within 150 miles (241 
    km) of the boundaries of U.S. counties or Canadian districts where Pd 
    or WNS had been detected.
        The interim 4(d) rule generally applies the prohibitions of 50 CFR 
    17.31 and 17.32 to the northern long-eared bat, which means that the 
    interim rule, among other things, prohibits the purposeful take of 
    northern long-eared bats throughout the species' range, but the interim 
    rule includes exceptions to the purposeful take prohibition. The 
    exceptions for purposeful take are: (1) In instances of removal of 
    northern long-eared bats from human structures (if actions comply with 
    all applicable State regulations); and (2) for authorized capture, 
    handling, and related activities of northern long-eared bats by 
    individuals permitted to conduct these same activities for other bat 
    species until May 3, 2016. Under the interim rule, incidental take is 
    not prohibited outside the WNS zone if the incidental take results from 
    otherwise lawful activities. Inside the WNS zone, there are exceptions 
    for incidental take for the following activities, subject to certain 
    conditions: Implementation of forest management; maintenance and 
    expansion of existing rights-of-way and transmission corridors; prairie 
    management; minimal tree removal; and removal of hazardous trees for 
    the protection of human life and property.
        This final 4(d) rule does not generally apply the prohibitions of 
    50 CFR 17.31 to the northern long-eared bat. This rule continues to 
    prohibit purposeful take of northern long-eared bats throughout the 
    species' range, except in certain cases, including instances of removal 
    of northern long-eared bats from human structures and for authorized 
    capture, handling, and related activities of northern long-eared bats 
    by individuals permitted to conduct these same activities for other bat 
    species until May 3, 2016. After May 3, 2016, a permit pursuant to 
    section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Act is required for the capture and handling 
    of northern long-eared bats. Under this rule, incidental take is still 
    not prohibited outside the WNS zone.
        We have revised the interim rule's language concerning incidental 
    take inside the WNS zone. Under this final rule, within the WNS zone, 
    incidental take is prohibited only if: (1) Actions result in the 
    incidental take of northern long-eared bats in hibernacula; (2) actions 
    result in the incidental take of northern long-eared bats by altering a 
    known hibernaculum's entrance or interior environment if the alteration 
    impairs an essential behavioral pattern, including sheltering northern 
    long-eared bats; or (3) tree-removal activities result in the 
    incidental take of northern long-eared bats when the activity either 
    occurs within 0.25 mile (0.4 kilometer) of a known hibernaculum, or 
    cuts or destroys known occupied maternity roost trees, or any other 
    trees within a 150-foot (45-meter) radius from the maternity roost 
    tree, during the pup season (June 1 through July 31). Take of northern 
    long-eared bats in their hibernacula may include disturbing or 
    disrupting hibernating individuals when they are in the hibernacula. 
    Take of northern long-eared bat also includes the physical or other 
    alteration of the hibernaculum's entrance or environment when bats are 
    not present if the result of the activity will impair essential 
    behavioral patterns, including sheltering northern long-eared bats. Any 
    take resulting from otherwise lawful activities outside known 
    hibernacula, other than tree removal, is not prohibited, as long as it 
    does not change the bat's access to or quality of a known hibernaculum 
    for the species. This final rule makes these revisions because, in 
    areas impacted by WNS, the most important conservation actions for the 
    northern long-eared bat are to protect bats in hibernacula and 
    maternity roost trees, and to continue to monitor populations in summer 
    habitat (e.g., identify where the species continues to survive after 
    the detection of Pd or WNS and determine the factors influencing its 
    resilience), while developing methods to abate WNS as quickly as 
    possible.
        Under this rule, we individually set forth prohibitions on 
    possession and other acts with unlawfully taken northern long-eared 
    bats, and on import and export of northern long-eared bats. These 
    prohibitions were included in the interim 4(d) through the general 
    application of the prohibitions of 50 CFR 17.31 to the northern long-
    eared bat. Under this rule, take of the northern
    
    [[Page 1903]]
    
    long-eared bat is also not prohibited for the following: Removal of 
    hazardous trees for protection of human life and property; take in 
    defense of life; and take by an employee or agent of the Service, of 
    the National Marine Fisheries Service, or of a State conservation 
    agency that is operating a conservation program pursuant to the terms 
    of a cooperative agreement with the Service. Regarding these three 
    exceptions, take in defense of life was not included in the interim 
    4(d) rule, but the other two exceptions were, either through the 
    general application of 50 CFR 17.31 or through a specific exception 
    included in the interim 4(d) rule.
    
    Provisions of the 4(d) Rule for the Northern Long-Eared Bat
    
        For a threatened species, the Act does not specify prohibitions, or 
    exceptions to those prohibitions, relative to take of the species. 
    Instead, under Section 4(d) of the Act, the Secretary has discretion to 
    issue regulations deemed to be necessary and advisable for the 
    conservation of a threatened species. By regulation, the Secretary has 
    determined that take prohibitions for endangered species are also 
    applicable to threatened species unless a special rule is issued under 
    section 4(d) for a particular threatened species. Under this 4(d) rule, 
    we have applied several of the prohibitions specified in the Act for 
    endangered species and the provisions of 50 CFR 17.32 (permit 
    regulations) to the northern long-eared bat as described below.
        For this 4(d) rule, the Service has completed a biological opinion 
    under Section 7 of the Act on our action of finalizing this rule. In 
    addition, the biological opinion provides for streamlined consultation 
    for all federal agency actions that may affect the northern long-eared 
    bat; therefore, the scope of the biological opinion included the 
    finalization and implementation of the 4(d) rule. The biological 
    opinion resulted in a non-jeopardy determination. Provided Federal 
    action agencies follow the criteria outlined in this rule and implement 
    the streamlined consultation process outlined in the biological 
    opinion, their section 7 consultation requirements will be met. If 
    unable to follow these criteria, standard section 7 procedures will 
    apply.
    
    Exceptions to the Purposeful Take Prohibition
    
        We have exempted the purposeful take of northern long-eared bats 
    related to the protection of human health and safety. A very small 
    percentage of bats may be infected with rabies or other diseases that 
    can be transmissible to humans. When there is the possibility that a 
    person has been exposed to a diseased bat, it is important that they 
    coordinate with medical professionals (e.g., doctor, local health 
    department) to determine the appropriate response. When warranted to 
    protect human health and safety, we have exempted from the take 
    prohibition of northern long-eared bats in defense of one's own life or 
    the lives of others, including for public health monitoring purposes 
    (i.e., collecting a bat after human exposure and submitting for disease 
    testing).
        We have also exempted the purposeful take of northern long-eared 
    bats related to removing the species from human structures, but only if 
    the actions comply with all applicable State regulations. Northern 
    long-eared bats have occasionally been documented roosting in human-
    made structures, such as houses, barns, pavilions, sheds, cabins, and 
    bat houses (Mumford and Cope 1964, p. 480; Barbour and Davis 1969, p. 
    77; Cope and Humphrey 1972, p. 9; Amelon and Burhans 2006, p. 72; 
    Whitaker and Mumford 2009, p. 209; Timpone et al. 2010, p. 119; Joe 
    Kath 2013, pers. comm.). We conclude that the overall impact of bat 
    removal from human structures is not expected to adversely affect 
    conservation and recovery efforts for the species. In addition, we 
    provide the following recommendations:
         Minimize use of pesticides (e.g., rodenticides) and avoid 
    use of sticky traps as part of bat evictions/exclusions.
         Conduct exclusions during spring or fall unless there is a 
    perceived public health concern from bats present during summer and/or 
    winter.
         Contact a nuisance wildlife specialist for humane 
    exclusion techniques.
        We have exempted the purposeful take that results from actions 
    relating to capture, handling, and related activities for northern 
    long-eared bats by individuals permitted to conduct these same 
    activities for other species of bats until May 3, 2016. Under the 
    interim rule, for a period of 1 year from the interim rule's effective 
    date (May 3, 2016), we had exempted the purposeful take that is caused 
    by the authorized capture, handling, and related activities (e.g., 
    attachment of radio transmitters for tracking) of northern long-eared 
    bats by individuals permitted to conduct these same activities for 
    other bats. We have continued the exemption through the expiration date 
    established by the interim rule. After May 3, 2016, a permit pursuant 
    to section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Act is required for the capture and 
    handling of northern long-eared bats,except that associated with bat 
    removal from human structures. We determined that it was important to 
    regulate the intentional capture and handling of northern long-eared 
    bats through the Act's scientific permit process to help ensure that 
    the surveyor's qualifications and methods used are adequate to protect 
    individual bats and provide reliable survey results.
    
    Incidental Take Outside of the WNS Zone Not Prohibited
    
        Incidental take in areas that have not yet been impacted by WNS 
    (i.e., in areas outside the WNS zone) is not prohibited by this final 
    rule. We believe the level of take associated with on-going land 
    management and development actions, including all actions that may 
    incidentally take the northern long-eared bat, do not individually or 
    cumulatively affect healthy bat populations. As noted in our decision 
    to list the northern long-eared bat as a threatened species, WNS is the 
    primary cause of the species' decline, and we would not have listed the 
    northern long-eared bat if not for the impact of WNS. In addition, we 
    conclude that regulating incidental take in areas not affected by WNS 
    is not expected to change the rate at which WNS progresses across the 
    range of the species. In other words, regulating incidental take 
    outside the WNS zone will not influence the future impact of the 
    disease throughout the species' range or the status of the species. For 
    these reasons, we have concluded that the prohibition of incidental 
    take outside of the WNS zone is not necessary and advisable for the 
    protection and recovery of the species. Incidental take, therefore, is 
    not prohibited outside of the WNS zone.
    
    Prohibitions and Exemptions Related to Incidental Take Inside the WNS 
    Zone
    
        Our approach to designing the regulatory provisions for the 
    northern long-eared bat inside the WNS zone reflects the significant 
    role WNS plays as the central threat affecting the species. For other 
    threatened species, habitat loss or other limiting factors usually 
    contribute to the decline of a species. In these situations, 
    regulations are needed to address either the habitat loss or the other 
    limiting factors.
        The northern long-eared bat is not habitat-limited and has 
    demonstrated a great deal of plasticity within its environment (e.g., 
    living in highly fragmented forest habitats to contiguous forest blocks 
    from the southern United States to Canada's Yukon Territory) in the 
    absence of WNS. For the northern long-eared bat, land management and
    
    [[Page 1904]]
    
    development actions that have been on-going for centuries (e.g., forest 
    management, forest conversion) have not been shown to have significant 
    negative impacts to northern long-eared bat populations.
        As WNS continues to move across the range of the species, northern 
    long-eared bat populations have declined and will continue to decline. 
    Declines in northern long-eared bat populations in WNS-positive regions 
    have been significant, and northern long-eared bats are now relatively 
    rare on those landscapes. As populations decline as a result of WNS, 
    the chances of any particular activity affecting northern long-eared 
    bats becomes more remote. Therefore, in the WNS zone, we focused the 
    regulatory provisions on sensitive life stages at known, occupied 
    maternity roost trees and hibernacula.
        We developed regulations that provide some level of protection to 
    the species where it persists in the face of WNS. However, we have 
    provided flexibility so that the regulated public will seek to conserve 
    the species and foster its recovery at sites where it has been lost 
    should tools to address WNS become available or where the species shows 
    signs of resilience. Further, because we believe recovery of this 
    species will require many partnerships across the species' range, 
    minimizing regulatory impacts on activities inconsequential to northern 
    long-eared bat populations provides an important step in building 
    partnerships for the species' recovery.
        The northern long-eared bat is a forest-dependent species, 
    typically roosting in trees. In establishing regulations that are 
    necessary and advisable for the conservation of the species, we have 
    tailored species-specific regulatory provisions toward potential 
    impacts to trees. For the incidental take of bats outside of 
    hibernacula, we have specifically established two sets of provisions: 
    the first set applies to activities that do not involve tree removal 
    and the second applies to activities that do involve tree removal. By 
    tree removal, we mean cutting down, harvesting, destroying, trimming, 
    or manipulating in any other way the trees, saplings, snags, or any 
    other form of woody vegetation that is likely to be used by the 
    northern long-eared bat.
        In this final 4(d) rule, we have limited the prohibition of 
    incidental take of northern long-eared bats to specific circumstances. 
    This does not mean that all activities that could result in the 
    incidental take of the northern long-eared bat will do so. The relative 
    exposure of the species and the species response to a potential 
    stressor are critical considerations in evaluating the potential for 
    incidental take to occur. For example, under the discussion of tree 
    removal, below, we describe what is prohibited by the final 4(d) rule 
    in the WNS zone and provide examples of how other activities could be 
    implemented in a way that avoids the potential for incidental take.
    
    Hibernacula
    
        Northern long-eared bats predominantly overwinter in hibernacula 
    that include caves and abandoned mines. For additional details about 
    the characteristics of the hibernacula selected by northern long-eared 
    bats, see the final listing determination (80 FR 17974; April 2, 2015). 
    Northern long-eared bats have shown a high degree of philopatry (using 
    the same site over multiple years) for a hibernaculum (Pearson 1962, p. 
    30), although they may not return to the same hibernaculum in 
    successive seasons (Caceres and Barclay 2000, p. 2).
        Hibernacula are so significant to the northern long-eared bat that 
    they are considered a primary driver in the species distribution (e.g., 
    Kurta 1982, p. 302). Northern long-eared bats are documented in 
    hibernacula in 29 of the 37 states in the species' range. Other States 
    within the species' range have no known hibernacula, which may reflect 
    that no suitable hibernacula are present, a limited survey effort, or 
    the northern long-eared bat's use of sites not previously identified as 
    suitable.
        In general, bats select hibernacula because they have 
    characteristics that allow the bats to meet specific life-cycle 
    requirements. Factors influencing a hibernaculum's suitability include 
    its physical structure (e.g., openings, interior space, depth), air 
    circulation, temperature profile, and location relative to foraging 
    sites (Tuttle and Stevenson 1978, pp. 108-121).
        Overwinter survival can be a particularly challenging period in the 
    northern long-eared bat's life cycle. Hibernating bats appear to 
    balance their physical condition (e.g., fat reserves upon entering 
    hibernation), hibernacula characteristics (e.g., temperature variation, 
    humidity), social resources (e.g., roosting singly or in groups), and 
    metabolic condition (i.e., degree of torpor, which is the state of 
    mental or physical inactivity) to meet overwinter survival needs. The 
    overwinter physiological needs of the species include maintaining body 
    temperature above freezing, minimizing water loss, meeting energetic 
    needs until prey again become available, and responding to disturbance 
    or disease. Because of this complex interplay of hibernacula 
    characteristics and bat physiology, changes to hibernacula can 
    significantly impact their suitability as well as the survival of any 
    hibernating bats.
        In general, northern long-eared bats arrive at hibernacula in 
    August or September, enter hibernation in October and November, and 
    emerge from the hibernacula in March or April (Caire et al. 1979, p. 
    405; Whitaker and Hamilton 1998, p. 100; Amelon and Burhans 2006, p. 
    72). However, hibernation may begin as early as August (Whitaker and 
    Rissler 1992b, p. 56). Northern long-eared bats have been observed 
    moving among hibernacula throughout the winter (Griffin 1940a, p. 185; 
    Whitaker and Rissler 1992a, p. 131; Caceres and Barclay 2000, pp. 2-3). 
    Whitaker and Mumford (2009, p. 210) found that this species flies in 
    and out of some mines and caves in southern Indiana throughout the 
    winter.
        Human disturbance of hibernating bats has long been considered a 
    threat to cave-hibernating bat species like the northern long-eared 
    bat. Modifications to bat hibernacula can affect the microclimate 
    (e.g., temperature, humidity) of the subterranean habitat, and thus the 
    ability of the cave or mine to support hibernating bats, including the 
    northern long-eared bat. Anthropogenic modifications to cave and mine 
    entrances may not only alter flight characteristics and access (Spanjer 
    and Fenton 2005, p. 1110), but may change airflow and alter internal 
    microclimates of the caves and mines, eliminating their utility as 
    hibernacula (Service 2007, p. 71). For example, Richter et al. (1993, 
    p. 409) attributed the decline in the number of Indiana bats at 
    Wyandotte Cave, Indiana (which harbors one of the largest known 
    population of hibernating Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis)), to an 
    increase in the cave's temperature resulting from restricted airflow 
    caused by a stone wall erected at the cave's entrance. In addition to 
    the direct access modifications to caves discussed above, debris 
    buildup at entrances or on cave gates can also significantly modify the 
    cave or mine site characteristics by restricting airflow and the course 
    of natural water flow. Water-flow restriction could lead to flooding, 
    thus drowning hibernating bats (Amelon and Burhans 2006, p. 72). Thomas 
    (1995, p. 942) used infrared detectors to measure flight activity in 
    hibernating northern long-eared bats and little brown bats in response 
    to the presence of a human observer. Flight activity significantly 
    increased with the presence of an observer, beginning within 30 minutes
    
    [[Page 1905]]
    
    of the visit, peaking 1.0 to 7.5 hours later, and remaining 
    significantly above baseline level for 2.5 to 8.5 hours. These results 
    suggest that hibernating bats are sensitive to non-tactile stimuli and 
    arouse and fly following human visits. Boyles and Brack's (2009) model 
    predicted that the survival rate of hibernating little brown bats drops 
    from 96 percent to 73 percent with human visitations to hibernacula. 
    Prior to the outbreak of WNS, Amelon and Burhans (2006, p. 73) 
    indicated that ``the widespread recreational use of caves and indirect 
    or direct disturbance by humans during the hibernation period pose the 
    greatest known threat to [the northern long-eared bat].''
        Hibernacula and surrounding forest habitats play important roles in 
    the life cycle of the northern long-eared bat beyond the time when the 
    bats are overwintering. In both the early spring and fall, the 
    hibernacula and surrounding forested habitats are the focus of bat 
    activity in two separate periods referred to as ``spring staging'' and 
    ``fall swarming.''
        During the spring staging, bats begin to gradually emerge from 
    hibernation, exit the hibernacula to feed, but re-enter the same or 
    alternative hibernacula to resume daily bouts of torpor (Whitaker and 
    Hamilton 1998, p. 100). The staging period for the northern long-eared 
    bat is likely short in duration (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998, p. 100; 
    Caire et al. 1979, p. 405). In Missouri, Caire et al. (1979, p. 405) 
    found that northern long-eared bats moved into the staging period in 
    mid-March through early May. In Michigan, Kurta et al. (1997, p. 478) 
    determined that by early May, two-thirds of the Myotis species, 
    including the northern long-eared bat, had dispersed to summer habitat.
        Beginning in mid to late summer, after their young have gained some 
    level of independence, northern long-eared bats exhibit a behavior near 
    hibernacula referred to as swarming. Both male and female northern 
    long-eared bats are present at swarming sites (often with other species 
    of bats). During this period, heightened activity and congregation of 
    transient bats around caves and mines is observed, followed later by 
    increased sexual activity and bouts of torpor prior to winter 
    hibernation (Fenton 1969, p. 601; Parsons et al. 2003, pp. 63-64; Davis 
    and Hitchcock 1965, pp. 304-306). The purposes of swarming behavior may 
    include introduction of juveniles to potential hibernacula, copulation, 
    and stopping over sites on migratory pathways between summer and winter 
    regions (Kurta et al. 1997, p. 479; Parsons et al. 2003, p. 64; Lowe 
    2012, p. 51; Randall and Broders 2014, pp. 109-110). The swarming 
    season for some species of the genus Myotis begins shortly after 
    females and young depart maternity colonies (Fenton 1969, p. 601). For 
    the northern long-eared bat, the swarming period may occur between July 
    and early October, depending on latitude within the species' range 
    (Fenton 1969, p. 598; Kurta et al. 1997, p. 479; Lowe 2012, p. 86; Hall 
    and Brenner 1968, p. 780; Caire et al. 1979, p. 405). The northern 
    long-eared bat may investigate several cave or mine openings during the 
    transient portion of the swarming period, and some individuals may use 
    these areas as temporary daytime roosts or may roost in forest habitat 
    adjacent these sites (Kurta et al. 1997, pp. 479, 483; Lowe 2012, p. 
    51). Little is known about northern long-eared bat roost selection 
    outside of caves and mines during the swarming period (Lowe 2012, p. 
    6).
        Based on the importance of hibernacula to northern long-eared bats, 
    take is prohibited in and around the hibernacula within the WNS zone, 
    including activities that may alter the hibernacula at any time of the 
    year. Further, we have determined that when the conservation measures 
    for the northern long-eared bat included in this final 4(d) rule are 
    applied to areas within 0.25 mile (0.4 km) of the hibernacula, the 
    potential for negative impacts to individuals is significantly reduced.
    
    Activities Not Involving Tree Removal Are Not Prohibited
    
        Under this final 4(d) rule, activities within the WNS zone not 
    involving tree removal are not prohibited provided they do not result 
    in the incidental take of northern long eared bats in hibernacula or 
    otherwise impair essential behavioral patterns at known hibernacula. In 
    our final listing determination (80 FR 17974; April 2, 2015), we 
    identified a number of activities not involving tree removal that may 
    have direct or indirect effects on northern long-eared bats. These 
    activities have the potential to cause the incidental take of northern 
    long-eared bats and include activities such as the operation of 
    utility-scale wind-energy turbines, application of pesticides, and 
    prescribed fire (this is not an exhaustive list; it is merely 
    representative of activities that may result in take of northern long-
    eared bats).
        At the time of our listing determination and the interim 4(d) rule 
    (80 FR 17974; April 2, 2015), we stated that we had no compelling 
    evidence that these activities would have significant effects on the 
    northern long-eared bat when considered alone. However, we thought 
    these factors may have a cumulative effect on this species when 
    considered in concert with WNS. After additional consideration and our 
    review of public comments received on the proposed and interim 4(d) 
    rules, we did not find compelling evidence that regulating these 
    potential cumulative effects would result in significant impacts at the 
    species level. Effects to relatively small numbers of individuals are 
    not anticipated to impair conservation efforts or the recovery 
    potential of the species.
    
    Wind-Energy Facilities
    
        Wind-energy facilities are found scattered throughout the range of 
    the northern long-eared bat, and many new facilities are anticipated to 
    be constructed over the next 15 years (United States Department of 
    Energy 2008, unpaginated). We reviewed post-construction mortality 
    monitoring studies conducted at various times from 1998 through 2014 at 
    81 unique operating wind-energy facilities in the range of the northern 
    long-eared bat in the United States and Canada (Service 2015, 
    unpublished data). In these studies, 43 northern long-eared bat 
    mortalities were documented at 19 of the sites. The northern long-eared 
    bat fatalities comprised less than 1 percent of all documented bat 
    mortalities. In most cases, the level of effort for most post-
    construction monitoring studies is not sufficient to confidently 
    exclude the possibility that infrequent fatalities are being missed, 
    but finding none or only small numbers over many sites and years can 
    suggest the order of what may be missed. Thus while sustained mortality 
    at particular facilities could potentially cause declines in local 
    populations of the northern long-eared bat, if that is in fact 
    occurring, it does not appear to be wide-spread at least when compared 
    to other bat species which are nearly always found in fatality 
    monitoring at wind facilities. At those sites with a northern long-
    eared bat fatality where multiple years of monitoring data were also 
    available for review (n = 12), fatalities of northern long-eared bats 
    were only reported in multiple years at two of the sites and for the 
    other 10 sites only a single fatality was reported over multiple years 
    of monitoring. For example, one site reported one northern long-eared 
    bat fatality in 2008, but none in 2009, 2010, or 2011. Further, the 
    number of fatalities of northern long-eared bats found at any given 
    site has been relatively small (e.g., most often a single fatality was 
    found, but in all cases no more than six), and typically most sites (62 
    out of 81) found
    
    [[Page 1906]]
    
    no northern long-eared bat fatalities at all. There is a great deal of 
    uncertainty related to extrapolating these numbers to generate an 
    estimate of total northern long-eared bat mortality at wind-energy 
    facilities due to variability in post-construction survey effort and 
    methodology (Huso and Dalthorp 2014, pp. 546-547). Further, bat 
    mortality can vary between years and between sites, and detected 
    carcasses are only a small percentage of total bat mortalities. 
    However, even with those limitations, northern long-eared bats were 
    rarely detected as mortalities, even when they were known to be common 
    on the landscape around the wind-energy facility.
        We recognize that several wind energy facilities have completed, or 
    are currently working to complete, habitat conservation plans (HCPs; 
    permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act) for other listed bat 
    species where the number of fatalities reported is also very low. When 
    the take of an endangered species is reasonably certain to occur, we 
    recommend that a project proponent secure incidental take coverage 
    pursuant to section 10 of the Act. Over the operational life of a wind 
    energy facility (typically anticipated to be at least 20 to 30 years), 
    the take of listed species may be reasonably certain to occur, even if 
    the level of mortalities annually is anticipated to be quite low. 
    However, this does not mean that prohibiting that incidental take in 
    the case of a threatened species is necessary and advisable for the 
    conservation of such a species. For the northern long-eared bat, we do 
    not anticipate that the fatalities that will be caused by wind energy 
    would meaningfully change the species' status in the foreseeable 
    future.
        In addition, the wind industry has recently published best 
    management practices establishing voluntary operating protocols, which 
    they expect ``to reduce impacts to bats from operating wind turbines by 
    as much as 30 percent'' (AWEA 2015, unpaginated). Given the large 
    numbers of other bat species impacted by wind energy (Hein et al. 2013, 
    p. 12) and the economic importance of bats in controlling agricultural 
    or forest pest species (Boyles et al. 2011, pp. 41-42; Maine and 
    Boyles, 2015, p. 12442), we anticipate that these new standards will be 
    adopted by the wind-energy sector and ultimately required by wind-
    energy-siting regulators at State and local levels. We recommend that 
    wind facilities adopt these operating protocols.
        Our primary reason for not establishing regulatory criteria for 
    wind-energy facilities is that the best available information does not 
    indicate significant impacts to northern long-eared bats from such 
    operations. We conclude that there may be adverse effects posed by 
    wind-energy development to individual northern long-eared bats; 
    however, there is no evidence suggesting that effects from wind-energy 
    development has led to significant declines in this species, nor is 
    there evidence that regulating the incidental take that is occurring 
    would meaningfully change the conservation or recovery potential of the 
    species in the face of WNS. Furthermore, with the adoption by wind-
    energy facilities of the new voluntary standards, risk to all bats, 
    including the northern long-eared bat, should be further reduced.
    
    Environmental Contaminants
    
        Environmental contaminants, in particular insecticides, pesticides, 
    and inorganic contaminants, such as mercury and lead, may also have 
    detrimental effects on individual northern long-eared bats. However, 
    across the wide-range of the species, it is unclear whether 
    environmental contaminants, regardless of the source (e.g., pesticide 
    applications, industrial waste-water), would be expected to cause 
    population-level impacts to the northern long-eared bat either 
    independently or in concert with WNS. Historically, the most 
    intensively-studied contaminants in bats have been the organochlorine 
    insecticides (OCs; O'Shea and Clark 2002, p. 238). During wide-spread 
    use of OCs in the 1960s and 1970s, lethal pesticide poisoning was 
    demonstrated in gray bats (Myotis grisescens), Mexican free-tailed bats 
    (Tadarida brasiliensis), and Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis) (O'Shea and 
    Clark 2002, p. 239, 242). Since the phasing out of OCs in the United 
    States, the effects of chemical contaminants on bats have been less 
    well studied (O'Shea and Johnston 2009, p. 501); however, a few recent 
    studies have demonstrated the accumulation of potentially toxic 
    elements and chemicals in North American bats. For instance, Yates et 
    al. (2014, pp. 48-49) quantified total mercury (Hg) levels in 1,481 fur 
    samples and 681 blood samples from 10 bat species captured across 8 
    northeastern U.S. States and detected the highest Hg levels in tri-
    colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus), little brown bats (Myotis 
    lucifugus) and northern long-eared bats. More recently, Secord et al. 
    (2015) analyzed tissue samples from 48 northeastern bat carcasses of 
    four species, including northern long-eared bats, and detected 
    accumulations of several contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), 
    including most commonly polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PDBEs; 100 
    percent of samples), salicylic acid (81 percent), thiabendazole (50 
    percent), and caffeine (23 percent). Digoxigenin, ibuprofen, warfarin, 
    penicillin V, testosterone, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) were 
    also present in at least 15 percent of samples. Compounds with the 
    highest concentrations were bisphenol A (397 ng/g), PDBE congeners 28, 
    47, 99, 100, 153, and 154 (83.5 ng/g), triclosan (71.3 n/g), caffeine 
    (68.3 ng/g), salicylic acid (66.4 ng/g), warfarin (57.6 ng/g), 
    sulfathiazole (55.8 ng/g), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (53.8 ng/
    g), and DEET (37.2 ng/g).
        Although there is the potential for direct and indirect 
    contaminant-related effects, mortality or other population-level 
    impacts have not been reported for northern long-eared bats. Long-term 
    sublethal effects of environmental contaminants on bats are largely 
    unknown; however, environmentally relevant exposure levels of various 
    contaminants have been shown to impair nervous system, endocrine, and 
    reproductive functioning in other wildlife (Yates et al. 2014, p. 52; 
    K[ouml]hler and Triebskorn 2013, p. 761; Colborn et al. 1993, p. 378). 
    Moreover, bats' high metabolic rates, longevity, insectivorous diet, 
    migration-hibernation patterns of fat deposition and depletion, and 
    immune impairment during hibernation, along with potentially 
    exacerbating effects of WNS, likely increase their risk of exposure to 
    and accumulation of environmental toxins (Secord et al. 2015, p. 411, 
    Yates et al. 2014, p. 46, Geluso et al. 1976, p. 184; Quarles 2013, p. 
    4, O'Shea and Clark 2002, p. 238). Following WNS-caused population 
    declines in northeastern little brown bats, Kannan et al. (2010) 
    investigated whether exposure to toxic contaminants could be a 
    contributing factor in WNS-related mortality. Although high 
    concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), PBDEs, 
    polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), and chlordanes were found in the fat 
    tissues of WNS-infected bats in New York, relative concentrations in 
    bats from an uninfected population in Kentucky were also high (Kannan 
    et al. 2010, p. 615). The authors concluded that the study's sample 
    sizes were too small to accurately associate contaminant exposure with 
    the effects of WNS in bats (Kannan et al. 2010, p. 618), but argued 
    that additional research is needed. Despite the lack of knowledge on 
    the effects of various contaminants on northern long-eared bats, we 
    recognize the potential for direct and indirect consequences.

    However, contaminant-related mortality has not been reported for 
    northern long-eared bats. Additionally, Ingersoll (2013, p. 9) 
    suggested it was unclear what other threats or combination of threats 
    other than WNS (e.g., changes to critical roosting or foraging habitat, 
    collisions, effects from chemicals) may be responsible for recent bat 
    declines.
    
    Prescribed Fire
    
        Prescribed fire is a useful forest-management tool. However, there 
    are potential negative effects from prescribed burning, including 
    direct mortality to the northern long-eared bat. Therefore, when using 
    prescribed burning as a management tool, fire frequency, timing, 
    location, and intensity all need to be considered to lower the risk of 
    incidental take of bats. Carter et al. (2002, pp. 140-141) suggested 
    that the risk of direct injury and mortality to southeastern forest- 
    dwelling bats resulting from summer prescribed fire is generally low. 
    During warm temperatures, bats are able to arouse from short-term 
    torpor quickly. Northern long-eared bats use multiple roosts, switch 
    roost trees often, and could likely use alternative roosts in unburned 
    areas, should fire destroy the current roost. Non-volant pups are 
    likely the most vulnerable to death and injury from fire. Although most 
    eastern bat species are able to carry their young for some time after 
    they are born (Davis 1970, pp. 187-189), the degree to which this 
    behavior would allow females to relocate their young if fire threatens 
    the nursery roost is unknown. The potential for death or injury 
    resulting from prescribed burning depends largely on site-specific 
    circumstances, e.g., fire intensity near the maternity roost tree and 
    the height above ground of pups in the maternity roost tree. Not all 
    fires through maternity roosting areas will kill or injure all pups 
    present.
        Bats are known to take advantage of fire-killed snags and continue 
    roosting in burned areas. Boyles and Aubrey (2006, pp. 111-112) found 
    that, after years of fire suppression, initial burning created abundant 
    snags, which evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) used extensively for 
    roosting. Johnson et al. (2010, pp. 115) found that after burning, male 
    Indiana bats roosted primarily in fire-killed maples. In the Daniel 
    Boone National Forest, Lacki et al. (2009, p. 5) radio-tracked adult 
    female northern long-eared bats before and after prescribed fire, 
    finding more roosts (74.3 percent) in burned habitats than in unburned 
    habitats. Burning may create more suitable snags for roosting through 
    exfoliation of bark (Johnson et al. 2009a, p. 240), mimicking trees in 
    the appropriate decay stage for roosting bats. In addition to creating 
    snags and live trees with roost features, prescribed fire may enhance 
    the suitability of trees as roosts by reducing adjacent forest clutter. 
    Perry et al. (2007, p. 162) found that five of six species, including 
    northern long-eared bat, roosted disproportionately in stands that were 
    thinned and burned 1 to 4 years prior but that still retained large 
    overstory trees.
        The use of prescribed fire, where warranted, will, in any given 
    year, impact only a small proportion of the northern long-eared bat's 
    range during the bats active period. In addition, there are substantial 
    benefits of prescribed fire for maintaining forest ecosystems. For 
    example, the U.S. Forest Service's Southern Region manages 
    approximately 10.9 million acres (4.4 million hectares (ha)) of land, 
    and the maximum estimate of acres where prescribed fire is employed 
    annually during the active period of northern-long eared bats (April 
    through October) was 320,577 acres (129,732 ha), which is less than 3 
    percent of the National Forest regional lands. Similarly, the Forest 
    Service's Eastern Region manages 15 Forests in 13 States that include 
    about 12.2 million acres (4.88 million ha), of which 11.3 million acres 
    (4.52 million ha) are forested habitat. The U.S. Forest Service 
    anticipates applying prescribed burning to 107,684 acres (43,073 ha) or 
    about 1percent of the forested habitat across the eastern region 
    annually. In addition, only 17,342 acres (6937 ha) (i.e., 0.15 percent 
    of the forested habitat) of prescribed burning annually is anticipated 
    to occur during the non-volant period on the eastern forests.
        Further, there are substantial benefits of prescribed fire for 
    maintaining forest ecosystems, such as providing the successional and 
    disturbance processes that renew the supply of suitable roost trees 
    (Silvis et. al. 2012, pp.6-7), as well as helping to ensure a varied 
    and reliable prey base (Dodd et. al. 2012, p. 269). There is no 
    evidence that prescribed fire has led to population-level declines in 
    this species nor is there evidence that regulating the incidental take 
    that might occur would meaningfully change the conservation status or 
    recovery potential of the species in the face of WNS.
    
    Hazardous Tree Removal Is Not Prohibited
    
        Under this final 4(d) rule, incidental take that is caused by 
    removal and management of hazardous trees is not prohibited. The 
    removal of these hazardous trees may be widely dispersed, but limited, 
    and should result in very minimal incidental take of northern long-
    eared bats. We recommend, however, that removal of hazardous trees be 
    done during the winter, wherever possible, when these trees will not be 
    occupied by northern long-eared bats. We conclude that the overall 
    impact of removing hazardous trees is not expected to adversely affect 
    conservation and recovery efforts for the species.
    
    Activities Involving Tree Removal
    
        We issued the interim species-specific rule under section 4(d) of 
    the Act in recognition that WNS is the primary threat to the species' 
    continued existence. We further recognized that all other (non-WNS) 
    threats cumulatively were not impacting the species at the population 
    level. Therefore, we apply the take prohibitions only to activities 
    that we have determined may impact the species in its most vulnerable 
    life stages, allowing for management flexibility and a limited 
    regulatory burden.
        In this final 4(d) rule, we have determined that the conservation 
    of the northern long-eared bat is best served by limiting the 
    prohibitions to the most vulnerable life stages of the northern long-
    eared bat (i.e., while in hibernacula or in maternity roost trees) 
    within the WNS zone and to activities, tree removal in particular, that 
    are most likely to affect the species. We have also revised some of the 
    conservation measures. To further simplify the regulation, we have 
    established separate prohibitions for activities involving tree removal 
    and those that do not involve tree removal. Within the WNS zone 
    incidental take outside of hibernacula that results from tree removal 
    is only prohibited when it (1) Occurs within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of 
    known northern long-eared bat hibernacula; or (2) cuts or destroys 
    known occupied maternity roost trees, or any other trees within a 150-
    foot (45-meter) radius from the known occupied maternity trees, during 
    the pup season (June 1 through July 31).
    
    Forest Management
    
        Forest management maintains forest habitat on the landscape, and 
    the impacts from management activities are, for the most part, 
    temporary in nature. Forest management is the practical application of 
    biological, physical, quantitative, managerial, economic, social, and 
    policy principles to the regeneration, management, utilization, and 
    conservation of forests to meet specified goals and objectives (Society 
    of American Foresters, http://dictionaryofforestry.org/dict/term/
    forest_
    
    [[Page 1908]]
    
    management). It includes a broad range of silvicultural practices and 
    this discussion specifically addresses tree-removal practices (e.g., 
    timber harvest) associated with forest management. Timber harvesting 
    includes a wide variety of practices from selected removal of 
    individual trees to clearcutting. Impacts to northern long-eared bats 
    from forest management would be expected to range from positive (e.g., 
    maintaining or increasing suitable roosting and foraging habitat within 
    northern long-eared bat home ranges) to neutral (e.g., minor amounts of 
    forest removal, forest management in areas outside northern long-eared 
    bat summer home ranges, forest management away from hibernacula) to 
    negative (e.g., death of adult females or pups or both resulting from 
    the removal of maternity roost trees).
        The best available data indicate that the northern long-eared bat 
    shows a varied degree of sensitivity to timber-harvesting practices. 
    For example, Menzel et al. (2002, p. 112) found northern long-eared 
    bats roosting in intensively managed stands in West Virginia, 
    indicating that there were sufficient suitable roosts (primarily snags) 
    remaining for their use. At the same study site, Owen et al. (2002, p. 
    4) concluded that northern long-eared bats roosted in areas with 
    abundant snags, and that in intensively managed forests in the central 
    Appalachians, roost availability was not a limiting factor. Northern 
    long-eared bats often chose black locust and black cherry as roost 
    trees, which were quite abundant and often regenerate quickly after 
    disturbance (e.g., timber harvest). Similarly, Perry and Thill (2007, 
    p. 222) tracked northern long-eared bats in central Arkansas and found 
    roosts were located in eight forest classes with 89 percent occurring 
    in three classes of mixed pine-hardwood forest. The three classes of 
    mixed pine-hardwood forest that supported the majority of the roosts 
    were partially harvested/thinned, unharvested (50 to 99 years old), and 
    group-selection harvested (Perry and Thill 2007, pp. 223-224).
        Certain levels of timber harvest may result in canopy openings, 
    which could result in more rapid development of young bats. In central 
    Arkansas, Perry and Thill (2007, pp. 223-224) found female bat roosts 
    were more often located in areas with partial harvesting than males, 
    with more male roosts (42 percent) in unharvested stands than female 
    roosts (24 percent). They postulated that females roosted in relatively 
    more open forest conditions because they may receive greater solar 
    radiation, which may increase developmental rates of young or permit 
    young bats a greater opportunity to conduct successful initial flights 
    (Perry and Thill 2007, p. 224). Cryan et al. (2001, p. 49) found 
    several reproductive and non-reproductive female northern long-eared 
    bat roost areas in recently harvested (less than 5 years) stands in the 
    Black Hills of South Dakota in which snags and small stems (diameter at 
    breast height (dbh)) of 2 to 6 inches (5 to 15 centimeters) were the 
    only trees left standing; however, the largest colony (n = 41) was 
    found in a mature forest stand that had not been harvested in more than 
    50 years.
        Forest size and continuity are also factors that define the quality 
    of habitat for roost sites for northern long-eared bats. Lacki and 
    Schwierjohann (2001, p. 487) stated that silvicultural practices could 
    meet both male and female roosting requirements by maintaining large-
    diameter snags, while allowing for regeneration of forests. Henderson 
    et al. (2008, p. 1825) also found that forest fragmentation affects 
    northern long-eared bats at different scales based on sex; females 
    require a larger unfragmented area with a large number of suitable 
    roost trees to support a colony, whereas males are able to use smaller, 
    more fragmented areas. Henderson and Broders (2008, pp. 959-960) 
    examined how female northern long-eared bats use the forest-
    agricultural landscape on Prince Edward Island, Canada, and found that 
    bats were limited in their mobility and activities are constrained when 
    suitable forest is limited. However, they also found that bats in a 
    relatively fragmented area used a building for colony roosting, which 
    suggests an alternative for a colony to persist in an area with fewer 
    available roost trees.
        In addition to impacts on roost sites, we considered effects of 
    forest-management practices on foraging and traveling behaviors of 
    northern long-eared bats. In southeastern Missouri, the northern long-
    eared bat showed a preference for contiguous tracts of forest cover 
    (rather than fragmented or wide open landscapes) for foraging or 
    traveling, and different forest types interspersed on the landscape 
    increased likelihood of occupancy (Yates and Muzika 2006, p. 1245). 
    Similarly, in West Virginia, female northern long-eared bats spent most 
    of their time foraging or travelling in intact forest, diameter-limit 
    harvests (70 to 90 year-old stands with 30 to 40 percent of basal area 
    removed in the past 10 years), and road corridors, with no use of 
    deferment harvests (similar to clearcutting) (Owen et al. 2003, p. 
    355). When comparing use and availability of habitats, northern long-
    eared bats preferred diameter-limit harvests and forest roads. In 
    Alberta, Canada, northern long-eared bats avoided the center of 
    clearcuts and foraged more in intact forest than expected (Patriquin 
    and Barclay 2003, p. 654). On Prince Edward Island, Canada, female 
    northern long-eared bats preferred open areas less than forested areas, 
    with foraging areas centered along forest-covered creeks (Henderson and 
    Broders 2008, pp. 956-958). In mature forests in South Carolina, 10 of 
    the 11 stands in which northern long-eared bats were detected were 
    mature stands (Loeb and O'Keefe 2006, p. 1215). Within those mature 
    stands, northern long-eared bats were more likely to be recorded at 
    points with sparse or medium vegetation rather than points with dense 
    vegetation, suggesting that some natural gaps within mature forests can 
    provide good foraging habitat for northern long-eared bats (Loeb and 
    O'Keefe 2006, pp. 1215-1217). However, in southwestern North Carolina, 
    Loeb and O'Keefe (2011, p. 175) found that northern long-eared bats 
    rarely used forest openings, but often used roads. Forest trails and 
    roads may provide small gaps for foraging and cover from predators 
    (Loeb and O'Keefe 2011, p. 175). In general, northern long-eared bats 
    appear to prefer intact mixed-type forests with small gaps (i.e., 
    forest trails, small roads, or forest-covered creeks) in forest with 
    sparse or medium vegetation for forage and travel rather than 
    fragmented habitat or areas that have been clearcut.
        Impacts to northern long-eared bats from forest management would be 
    expected to vary depending on the timing of tree removal, location 
    (within or outside northern long-eared bat home range), and extent of 
    removal. While bats can flee during tree removal, removal of occupied 
    roosts (during spring through fall) may result in direct injury or 
    mortality to some percentage of northern long-eared bats. This 
    percentage would be expected to be greater if flightless pups or 
    inexperienced flying juveniles were also present. Forest management 
    outside of northern long-eared bat summer home ranges or away from 
    hibernacula would not be expected to affect the conservation of the 
    species.
        Forest management is not usually expected to result in a permanent 
    loss of suitable roosting or foraging habitat for northern long-eared 
    bats. On the contrary, forest management is expected to maintain a 
    forest over the long term for the species. However, localized temporary 
    reductions in suitable roosting and/or foraging habitat can occur from 
    various forest practices (e.g.,
    
    [[Page 1909]]
    
    clearcuts). As stated above, northern long-eared bats have been found 
    in forests that have been managed to varying degrees, and as long as 
    there is sufficient suitable roosting and foraging habitat within their 
    home range and travel corridors between those areas, we would expect 
    northern long-eared bat colonies to continue to occur in managed 
    landscapes. However, in areas with WNS, northern long-eared bats may be 
    less resilient to stressors and maternity colonies are smaller. Given 
    the low inherent reproductive potential of northern long-eared bats 
    (one pup per female per year), death of adult females or pups or both 
    during tree felling could reduce the long-term viability of some of the 
    WNS-impacted colonies if they are also in the relatively small 
    percentage of forest habitat directly affected by forest management.
        As we documented in the interim 4(d) rule, forestry management and 
    silviculture are vital to the long-term survival and recovery of the 
    species. Based on information obtained during comment periods, 
    approximately 2 percent of forests in States within the range of the 
    northern long-eared bat are impacted by forest management activities 
    annually (Boggess et al., 2014, p.9). Of this amount, in any given 
    year, a smaller fraction of forested habitat would be impacted during 
    the active season when female bats and pups are most vulnerable. 
    Therefore, we have determined that when the prohibitions for the 
    northern long-eared bat included in this final 4(d) rule are applied to 
    forest management activities, the potential impacts will be 
    significantly reduced.
    
    Forest Conversion
    
        In our listing determination for the northern long-eared bat, we 
    noted that current and future forest conversion may have negative 
    additive impacts where the species has been impacted by WNS (80 FR 
    17991; April 2, 2015). Our assessment was based largely on the species' 
    summer-home-range fidelity and the potential for increased energetic 
    demands for individuals where the loss of summer habitat had been 
    removed or degraded (e.g., fragmentation). We noted that forest 
    conversion ``can result in a myriad of effects to the species, 
    including direct loss of habitat, fragmentation of remaining habitat, 
    and direct injury or mortality'' (80 FR 17993; April 2, 2015). In the 
    interim 4(d) rule we exempted most forest-management activities except 
    for the conversion of mature hardwood or mixed forest into intensively 
    managed monoculture-pine plantation stands, or non-forested landscape 
    (80 FR 18025; April 2, 2015).
        Many of the comments on the proposed and interim 4(d) rules noted 
    that habitat is not limiting for the northern long-eared bat. As we 
    documented in the final listing determination (80 FR 1802; April 2, 
    2015), the extent of conversion from forest to other land cover types 
    has been fairly consistent with conversion to forest (cropland 
    reversion/plantings). Further, the recent past and projected amounts of 
    forest loss to conversion was, and is anticipated to be, only a small 
    percentage of the total amount of forest habitat. For example by 2060, 
    4 to 8 percent of the forested area found in 2007 across the 
    conterminous United States is expected to be lost (U.S Forest Service 
    2012, p. 12). The northern long-eared bat has been documented to use a 
    wide variety of forest types across its wide range. Therefore, we agree 
    that the availability of forested habitat does not now, nor will it 
    likely in the future, limit the conservation of the northern long-eared 
    bat.
        We have determined that when the prohibitions for the northern 
    long-eared bat included in this final 4(d) rule are applied to forest-
    conversion activities, the potential for negative additive impacts to 
    individuals or colonies is significantly reduced. As WNS impacts bat 
    populations, unoccupied, suitable forage and roosting habitat will be 
    increasingly available for remaining bats.
    
    Tree-Removal Conservation Measures
    
        Under this final 4(d) rule, incidental take within the WNS zone 
    involving tree removal is not prohibited if two conservation measures 
    are followed. The first measure is the application of a 0.25 mile (0.4 
    km) buffer around known occupied northern long-eared bat hibernacula. 
    The second conservation measure is that the activity does not cut or 
    destroy known occupied maternity roost trees, or any other trees within 
    a 150-foot (45-m) radius around the maternity roost tree, during the 
    pup season (June 1 through July 31). The rationale for these measures 
    is discussed below.
    Conservation Measure 1: Tree Removal Near Known Northern Long-eared Bat 
    Hibernacula
        ``Known hibernacula'' are defined as locations where one or more 
    northern long-eared bats have been detected during hibernation or at 
    the entrance during fall swarming or spring emergence. Given the 
    documented challenges of surveying for northern long-eared bats in the 
    winter (use of cracks, crevices that are inaccessible to surveyors), 
    any hibernacula with northern long-eared bats observed at least once, 
    will continue to be considered ``known hibernacula'' as long as the 
    hibernacula remains suitable for the northern long-eared bat. A 
    hibernaculum remains suitable for northern long-eared bats even when Pd 
    or WNS has been detected.
        We have adopted the 0.25-mile (0.4-km) buffer around known northern 
    long-eared bat hibernacula for several reasons: (1) It will help to 
    protect micro-climate characteristics of the hibernacula; (2) for many 
    known hibernacula, bats use multiple entrances that may not be 
    reflected in the primary location information (e.g., bats may use other 
    smaller entrances that are often spread out from the main entrance 
    accessed for surveys or other purposes) and the hibernacula may have 
    extensive underground features that extend out from known entrances; 
    (3) in the late summer and fall when bat behavior begins to center on 
    hibernacula (swarming), it appears that northern long-eared bats may 
    roost in a widely dispersed area, which may reduce the potential that 
    any activity outside of this buffer would significantly affect the 
    species; (4) outside of the maternity period, northern long-eared bats 
    have demonstrated the ability to adapt to forest-management-related and 
    other types of disturbances; and (5) regardless of the buffer size, 
    bats will remain fully protected from take while in the hibernacula, 
    when they are most vulnerable.
        The microclimate, temperature, humidity, and air and water flow 
    within a hibernaculum are all important variables that could 
    potentially be impacted by forest management or other activities when 
    conducted in proximity to a hibernaculum. A 0.25-mile (0.4-km) buffer 
    will protect the hibernaculum's microclimate. Studies that have 
    evaluated the depth of edge influence from forest edge or tree removal 
    on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and light penetration suggest 
    that although highly variable among forest types and other site-
    specific factors (such as aspect and season), the depth of edge 
    influence can range from 164 feet (50 m) (Matlack 1993, p. 193) to over 
    1,312 feet (400 m) (Chen et al. 1995, p. 83). However, the hibernacula 
    often selected by northern long-eared bats are ``large, with large 
    passages'' (Raesly and Gates 1987, p. 20), and may be less affected by 
    relatively minor surficial micro-climatic changes that might result 
    from the limited exempted activities outside of the 0.25-mile (0.4-km) 
    buffer. Further, bats rarely hibernate near the entrances of structures 
    (Grieneisen 2011, p. 10), as these areas can be subject to greater
    
    [[Page 1910]]
    
    predation (Grieneisen 2011, p. 10; Kokurewicz 2004, p. 131) and daily 
    temperature fluctuations (Grieneisen 2011, p. 10). Davis et al. (1999, 
    p. 311) reported that partial clearcutting ``appears not to affect 
    winter temperatures deep in caves.'' Caviness (2003, p. 130) reported 
    that prescribed burns were found to have no notable influence on bats 
    hibernating in various caves in the Ozark National Forest. All bats 
    present in caves at the beginning of the burn were still present and in 
    ``full hibernation'' when the burn was completed, and bat numbers 
    increased in the caves several days after the burn. There were minute 
    changes in relative humidity and temperature during the burn, and 
    elevated short-term levels of some contaminants from smoke were noted.
        Northern long-eared bat hibernacula can be large and complex and, 
    spatially, may not be fully represented in locational information 
    contained in species records by State or Federal agencies or by natural 
    heritage programs. A 0.25-mile (0.4-km) buffer will help protect the 
    spatial extent of many known hibernacula. For example, one limestone 
    mine in Ohio used by northern long-eared bats had approximately 44 
    miles (71 km) of passages and multiple entrances (Brack 2007, p. 740). 
    In northern Michigan, bats (including northern long-eared bats) 
    occupied mines that were more structurally complex and longer (1,007 ft 
     2,837 ft (307m  865 m) than mines that were 
    unoccupied, and the occupied mines had a total length of passages that 
    ranged from 33 feet to 4 miles (10 meters to 6.4 kilometers) (Kurta and 
    Smith 2014, p. 592).
        Only a relatively small proportion of the areas where swarming 
    northern long-eared bats may occur are likely to be affected by tree-
    removal activity. There are over 1,500 known hibernacula for the 
    species in the United States (Service 2015, unpublished data), several 
    known in Canada, and potentially many others yet to be identified. Lowe 
    (2012, p. 58) reported that the roosts of northern long-eared bats were 
    evenly distributed over distances within 4.6 miles (7.3 km) from a 
    swarming site. If the northern long-eared bat's potential swarming 
    habitat (including foraging habitat during that period) can be 
    approximated as the forest habitat within 5 miles (8.1 km) of 
    hibernacula, that equates to a 50,265 acre (20,342 ha) area per 
    hibernaculum. In any given year, only a small proportion of the forest 
    habitat within the potential swarming habitat is likely to be impacted 
    by tree-removal activities (e.g., generally 2 percent of forests are 
    managed in any given year and over 1,500 hibernacula documented as used 
    by the species). Similarly, forest conversion is anticipated to be 
    relatively small compared to available habitat; therefore, based on our 
    current understanding of potential swarming-habitat, on the scale of 
    50,000 acres (20, 342ha) per hibernaculum, the relatively small foot-
    print of activities not prohibited by this final rule are unlikely to 
    affect the conservation or recovery potential of the species. Raesly 
    and Gates (1987, p. 24) evaluated external habitat characteristics of 
    hibernacula and reported that for the northern long-eared bat the 
    percentage of cultivated fields within 0.6 miles (1 km) of the 
    hibernacula was greater (52.6 percent) for those caves used by the 
    species, than for those caves not used by the species (37.7 percent), 
    suggesting that the removal of some forest around a hibernacula can be 
    consistent with the species needs.
        Outside of the maternity period, northern long-eared bats have 
    demonstrated the ability to respond successfully to forest-management-
    related and other types of disturbances. Therefore, the limited 
    disturbance associated with incidental-take exceptions outside of the 
    0.25-mile (0.4-km) buffer on hibernacula is consistent with the 
    conservation of the species. For example, Silvis et al.'s (2015, p.1) 
    experimental removal of roosts suggested that the ``loss of a primary 
    roost or 20 percent of secondary roosts in the dormant season may not 
    cause northern long-eared bats to abandon roosting areas or 
    substantially alter some roosting behaviors in the following active 
    season when tree-roosts are used.''
        Prior to WNS, the most significant risk identified for northern 
    long-eared bat conservation was direct human disturbance while bats are 
    hibernating (e.g., Olson et al. 2011, p. 228; Bilecki 2003, p. 55; 
    Service 2012, unpublished data). This final 4(d) rule (within the WNS 
    zone) addresses these impacts.
        We have prohibited incidental take of northern long-eared bats 
    under specific tree-removal circumstances; however, that does not mean 
    that all activities involving tree-removal activities within the 0.25-
    mile (0.4-k) buffer of hibernacula will result in take. For example, a 
    timber harvest might be conducted within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of a 
    hibernaculum at a time when bats are unlikely to be roosting in trees 
    within the buffer (e.g., winter), which fully protects any bats in the 
    hibernaculum as well as the hibernaculum's suitability for bats (i.e., 
    access, microclimate), and does not significantly change the 
    suitability of the habitat for foraging by northern long-eared bats or 
    perhaps even improves prey availability. In such a case, the timber 
    harvest, although closer than 0.25 miles (0.4 km) to the hibernaculum, 
    is not likely to result in incidental take so we would not recommend 
    that the harvester seek authorization for incidental take pursuant to 
    the Act. For activities planned within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of 
    hibernaculum, we encourage you to contact the local Ecological Services 
    Field Office (<http://www.fws.gov/offices>) to help evaluate the 
    potential for take of northern long-eared bats.
    Conservation Measure 2: Tree Removal Near Known Maternity Roost Trees
        Female northern long-eared bats roost communally in trees in the 
    summer (Foster and Kurta 1999, p. 667) and exhibit fission-fusion 
    behavior (Garroway and Broders 2007, p. 961), where members frequently 
    roost together (fusion), but the composition and size of the groups is 
    not static, with individuals frequently departing to be solitary or to 
    form smaller or different groups (fission) (Barclay and Kurta 2007, p. 
    44). As part of this behavior, northern long-eared bats switch tree 
    roosts often (Sasse and Pekins 1996, p. 95), typically every 2 to 3 
    days (Foster and Kurta 1999, p. 665; Owen et al. 2002, p. 2; Carter and 
    Feldhamer 2005, p. 261; Timpone et al. 2010, p. 119). In Missouri, the 
    longest time spent roosting in one tree was 3 nights (Timpone et al. 
    2010, p. 118). Bats switch roosts for a variety of reasons, including 
    temperature, precipitation, predation, parasitism, sociality, and 
    ephemeral roost sites (Carter and Feldhamer 2005, p. 264).
        Maternity colonies, consisting of females and young, are generally 
    small, numbering from about 30 (Whitaker and Mumford 2009, p. 212) to 
    60 individuals (Caceres and Barclay 2000, p. 3); however, one group of 
    100 adult females was observed in Vermilion County, Indiana (Whitaker 
    and Mumford 2009, p. 212) and Lereculeur (2013, p. 25) documented a 
    colony of at least 116 northern long-eared bats. In West Virginia, 
    maternity colonies in two studies had a range of 7 to 88 individuals 
    (Owen et al. 2002, p. 2) and 11 to 65 individuals, with a mean size of 
    31 (Menzel et al. 2002, p. 110). Lacki and Schwierjohann (2001, p. 485) 
    found that the number of bats within a given roost declined as the 
    summer progressed. Pregnant females formed the largest aggregations 
    (mean=26) and post-lactating females formed the smallest aggregation 
    (mean=4). Their largest overall reported colony size was 65 bats.
    
    [[Page 1911]]
    
        Northern long-eared bats change roost trees frequently, but use 
    roost areas repeatedly and to a lesser extent, reuse specific roosts 
    (e.g., Cryan et al. 2001, p. 50; Foster and Kurta 1999, p. 665). The 
    northern long-eared bat appears to be somewhat flexible in tree-roost 
    selection, selecting varying roost tree species and types of roosts 
    throughout its range. Females tend to roost in more open areas than 
    males, likely due to the increased solar radiation, which aids pup 
    development (Perry and Thill 2007, p. 224). Fewer trees surrounding 
    maternity roosts may also benefit juvenile bats that are starting to 
    learn to fly (Perry and Thill 2007, p. 224). Female roost-site 
    selection, in terms of canopy cover and tree height, changes depending 
    on reproductive stage; relative to pre- and post-lactation periods, 
    lactating northern long-eared bats have been shown to roost higher in 
    tall trees situated in areas of relatively less canopy cover and lower 
    tree density (Garroway and Broders 2008, p. 91).
        The northern long-eared bat's tendency for frequent roost switching 
    may help them avoid or respond effectively to disturbance by people 
    outside of the maternity season. The frequent-roost-switching behavior 
    of northern long-eared bat suggests that they are adapted to responding 
    quickly to changes in roost availably (ephemeral roosts), changing 
    environmental conditions (temperature), prey availability, or 
    physiological needs (torpor, reproduction). In a study of radio-tracked 
    northern long-eared bats responding to the disturbance from prescribed 
    fire (Dickinson et al. 2009, pp. 55-57), the bats appeared ``to limit 
    their exposure to conditions created by fire. At no point did they fly 
    outside of their typical home range area, nor did they travel far from 
    the burn itself.'' While some of the bats soon returned to areas 
    recently burned, by day 6 and 7 post burn, they ``appeared to return to 
    pre-burn norms in terms of emergence time, length of foraging bouts, 
    and use of the burn unit and adjacent habitats.'' Carter et al. (2000, 
    pp 139-140), noted that ``During the summer months, bats are able to 
    arouse quickly as the difference between the ambient temperature and 
    active body temperature of bats is less. Most bat species utilizing 
    trees and snags have multiple roosts throughout the forest (Sasse and 
    Pekins 1996; Callahan et al. 1997; Menzel et al. 1998; Foster and Kurta 
    1999, Menzel et al. 2001), providing alternate roosts should the 
    current roost be destroyed by fire.'' Sparks et al. (2008, pp. 207-208) 
    documented that northern long-eared bats released in the open during 
    the day demonstrated a successful rapid ``flight-to-cover'' response.
        Adult females give birth to a single pup (Barbour and Davis 1969, 
    p. 104). Birthing within the colony tends to be synchronous, with the 
    majority of births occurring around the same time (Krochmal and Sparks 
    2007, p. 654). Parturition (birth) likely occurs in late May or early 
    June (Caire et al. 1979, p. 406; Easterla 1968, p. 770; Whitaker and 
    Mumford 2009, p. 213), but may occur as late as July (Whitaker and 
    Mumford 2009, p. 213). Upon birth, the pups are unable to fly, and 
    females return to nurse the pups between foraging bouts at night. In 
    other Myotis species, mother bats have been documented carrying 
    flightless young to a new roosting location (Humphrey et al. 1977, p. 
    341). The ability of a mother to move young may be limited by the size 
    of the growing pup. Juvenile volancy (flight) often occurs by 21 days 
    after birth (Krochmal and Sparks 2007, p. 651; Kunz 1971, p. 480) and 
    has been documented as early as 18 days after birth (Krochmal and 
    Sparks 2007, p. 651). Prior to gaining the ability to fly, juvenile 
    bats are particularly vulnerable to tree-removal activities. Based on 
    this information, we have determined that the most sensitive period to 
    protect pups at maternity roost trees is from June 1 through July 31 
    (the ``pup season'').
        Known occupied maternity roost trees are defined as trees that have 
    had female northern long-eared bats or juvenile bats tracked to them or 
    the presence of female or juvenile bats is known as a result of other 
    methods. Once documented, northern-long eared bats are known to 
    continue to use the same roosting areas. Therefore, a tree will be 
    considered to be a ``known, occupied maternity roost'' as long as the 
    tree and surrounding habitat remain suitable for northern long-eared 
    bats. The incidental take prohibition for known, occupied maternity 
    roosts trees applies only during the during the pup season (June 1 
    through July 31).
        In addition to protecting the known roosts, we have also included 
    in this conservation measure avoiding the cutting or destroying of any 
    other trees within a 150-foot (45-meter) radius from the known, 
    occupied maternity roost tree during the pup season (June 1 through 
    July 31). Leaving a buffer of other trees around the maternity roost 
    tree will help to protect the roost tree from damage or destruction 
    that may be caused by other nearby trees being removed as well as 
    helping protect the roost tree from wind throw and micro-climate 
    changes. O'Keefe (2009 p. 42) documented that a 39-foot (12-meter) 
    buffer around a maternity roost tree during a harvest in May allowed 
    the roost to be successfully used through late July and that one 
    buffered tree was used 2 years in a row. We have adopted a standard for 
    exception of take that is almost four times that which proved effective 
    in this example, in order to better account for the variation in forest 
    types used by the northern long-eared bat and a variety of slopes that 
    might influence how large a buffer may need to be in order to prove 
    effective. Roost trees used by northern long-eared bats are often in 
    fairly close proximity to each other within the species' summer home 
    range. For female northern long-eared bats, the mean distance between 
    roosts was reported as 63m to 600m from a variety of studies published 
    1996 through 2014 (Foster and Kurta 1999 p. 665; Cryan et al. 2001, p. 
    46; Swier 2003, pp. 58-59; Jackson 2004, p. 89; Henderson and Broders 
    2008, p. 958; Johnson et al. 2009, p. 240; Badin 2014, p. 76; Bohrman 
    and Fecske, unpublished data). Further, within that data, the distance 
    between roosts was reported as small as 5 meters in one study (Badin 
    2014, p. 76) and 36 meters in another (Jackson 2004, p. 89). As Sasse 
    1995, p. 23, noted ``some roost sites appeared to be 'clustered' 
    together.'' Therefore, even this modest additional buffer may also 
    protect other roosts trees used by female northern long-eared bats 
    during the maternity period that have not yet been documented. In 
    addition, because colonies occupy more than one maternity roost in a 
    forest stand and individual bats frequently change roosts, in some 
    cases a portion of a colony or social network is likely to be protected 
    by multiple 150-foot buffers during the maternity season.
        Currently, since most States and natural heritage programs do not 
    track roosts and many have not tracked any northern long-eared bat 
    occurrences, we recognize that not all northern long-eared bat 
    maternity roost sites are known. Therefore, this measure will not 
    protect an unknown maternity roosts unless it falls under one of the 
    buffers related to protecting a known roost or hibernaculum.
        Although not fully protective of every individual, the conservation 
    measures identified in this final rule help protect maternity colonies. 
    This final species-specific rule under section 4(d) of the Act provides 
    the regulatory flexibility for certain activities to occur that have 
    not been the cause of the species' imperilment, while allowing us to 
    focus conservation efforts on WNS, promoting
    
    [[Page 1912]]
    
    conservation of the species across its range.
    
    Additional Prohibitions and Exceptions
    
        In this final 4(d) rule we carry forward other standard 
    prohibitions and exceptions that are typically applied to threatened 
    species and are currently applicable under the interim rule for the 
    northern long-eared bat. These prohibitions included the possession of 
    and other acts with unlawfully taken northern long-eared bats, as well 
    as import and export. We also included standard exemptions, including 
    all the permitting provisions of 50 CFR 17.32 and the exemption for 
    employees or agents of the Service, of the National Marine Fisheries 
    Service, or of a State conservation agency when acting in the course of 
    their official duties to take northern long-eared bats covered by an 
    approved cooperative agreement to carry out conservation programs.
    
    Summary of Comments and Recommendations on the Proposed and Interim 
    4(d) Rules
    
        The northern long-eared bat was listed as a threatened species 
    under the Act, with an interim rule under section 4(d) of the Act, on 
    April 2, 2015 (80 FR 17974). At that time, the Service invited public 
    comments on the interim 4(d) rule for 90 days, ending July 1, 2015. The 
    Service had already received comments for 60 days on its proposed 4(d) 
    rule (80 FR 2371, January 16, 2015). In total, the Service received 
    approximately 40,500 comments on the proposed and interim 4(d) rules. 
    We discuss them below.
    
    Peer Reviewer Comments
    
        1. Comment: Peer reviewer(s) commented that the 0.25-mile (radius) 
    around hibernacula is an inadequate buffer. There were additional 
    suggestions for alternative buffer distances as well as more detail on 
    how activities might be limited within those buffers. A specific 
    suggestion of a 1.6-mile buffer was made, with a statement that most 
    forest practices could occur within the buffer provided that the trees 
    were not completely removed (conversion). In addition, a suggestion of 
    0.5-mile buffer was made.
        Our Response: We have revised the approach used in this final 4(d) 
    rule to ensure that hibernating northern long-eared bats in the WNS 
    zone are protected from incidental take independent of the buffer size 
    used in the conservation measure. In addition, all northern long-eared 
    bats both in and outside of the WNS zone are protected from purposeful 
    take (e.g., killing or intentionally harassing northern long-eared 
    bats), including while in the hibernacula where they are most 
    vulnerable. We have retained the 0.25-mile buffer (0.25-mile radius 
    around known hibernacula entrance/access points used by bats) to 
    further protect the hibernaculum and associated forested habitat for 
    several reasons (see discussion above under Conservation Measure 1: 
    Tree Removal Near Known Northern Long-eared Bat Hibernacula). Some of 
    the peer-reviewers recommended that within the hibernacula buffer that 
    certain limited activities should be allowed (e.g., timber harvest that 
    only removes a small percentate of the forest habitat when bats are not 
    active). As discussed above under Conservation Measure 1: Tree Removal 
    Near Known Northern Long-eared Bat Hibernacula, not all tree-removal 
    activities within the buffer of hibernacula will result in take. For 
    example, a timber harvest might be conducted within the buffer when 
    bats are unlikely to be roosting in trees (e.g., winter) that fully 
    protects any bats in the hibernaculum as well as the hibernaculum's 
    suitability for bats (i.e., access, microclimate), and does not 
    significantly change the suitability of the habitat for foraging by 
    northern long-eared bats or perhaps even improves prey availability. In 
    such a case, the timber harvest, although within the buffer, is not 
    likely to result in incidental take so we would not recommend that the 
    harvester seek authorization for incidental take pursuant to the Act. 
    Because the buffer only applies to actions that result in incidental 
    take of the northern long-eared bat, we determined that there was no 
    need to attempt to exempt activities (e.g., a limited timber harvest) 
    where incidental take is unlikely.
        2. Comment: Peer reviewer(s) commented that the WNS buffer zone 
    should be removed and protections should occur throughout the range of 
    the species.
        Our Response: We have established prohibitions on the purposeful 
    take of northern long eared bats throughout the species range. However, 
    because WNS is the most significant threat known to be imperiling the 
    species, we have determined that in areas where WNS has not been 
    detected, additional prohibitions are not warranted. We recognize that 
    the WNS zone will change over time. We remain committed to regularly 
    updating the WNS zone map as new information about the spread of the Pd 
    fungus becomes known.
        3. Comment: Peer reviewer(s) commented that the WNS buffer zone 
    should be expanded and/or changed to accommodate a more site-specific 
    approach, based on proximity to hibernacula, for example.
        Our Response: We reevaluated the approach to the WNS zone in this 
    final rule and determined that the 150-mile buffer used for the interim 
    4(d) rule appears to be very effective in capturing counties where new 
    Pd detections are reported, in particular when looking at the new 
    occurrences over the last 5 years. For more details of this analysis, 
    please see our discussion in the WNS Zone section of this rule.
        4. Comment: Peer reviewer(s) commented that the Service's 
    definitions relative to forestry practices should be more precise and 
    should use silviculture terminology.
        Our Response: We have revised the prohibitions to no longer use 
    specific forestry practices or silviculture terminology. Take of the 
    northern long-eared bat within the context of forest management is not 
    prohibited provided that conservation measures to protect hibernacula 
    and known maternity roost trees are implemented as described in this 
    rule.
        5. Comment: Peer reviewer(s) recommended that the seasonal 
    restrictions for the northern long-eared bat ``pup season'' be expanded 
    and/or based on climate and geography within the species' range.
        Our Response: We recognize that in some areas or in some years the 
    period when young northern long-eared bats are non-volant may be 
    earlier or later than the June and July timeframe. The timing of when 
    northern long-eared bats give birth is likely a complex interplay of a 
    variety of factors affecting fetal development (e.g., condition of the 
    mother, temperature, prey availability), and similar factors may also 
    influence the time required for young to develop the ability to fly. In 
    addition, a study in West Virginia documented that the peak pregnancy 
    and lactation dates shifted post WNS (Francl et al. 2012, p. 36). 
    However, looking across a variety of studies, the June and July 
    timeframe appears to generally capture what is typically reported as 
    the non-volant period for northern long-eared bats across much of their 
    range within the United States. We have determined that a single 
    timeframe for implementing the prohibition on maternity roost tree 
    removal provides clarity for the regulated public. In addition, while 
    it does not modify the incidental take prohibition established in these 
    regulations, our local field offices may be able to provide more 
    refined local estimates of the non-volant period for specific areas. 
    Project planners may choose to use these local estimates for
    
    [[Page 1913]]
    
    planning purposes where they are available.
        6. Comment: Peer reviewer(s) recommended year-round protections for 
    maternity roost trees or conversely that we remove entirely the 
    protections for maternity trees because it is ineffective and serves as 
    a disincentive for conducting surveys.
        Our Response: Although northern long-eared bats have been 
    documented to use some roost trees over multiple years, in many cases 
    it is because the tree is dead or dying or has structural defects that 
    provides the roosting features attractive to the species. Further, 
    maternity roost trees are used only briefly (e.g., northern long-eared 
    bats typically change roosts every few days, and only a relatively 
    small percentage of those are used more than once in any one season). 
    Given that maternity roosts trees are ephemeral on the landscape and 
    used for very short periods of time in the active season, we determined 
    that year-round protections for known, occupied maternity roost trees 
    are not warranted. We considered removing the protections for known, 
    occupied maternity roosts as recommended by another peer reviewer, but 
    instead modify the protection so as to minimize the disincentive for 
    conducting surveys. In developing this final rule, we kept protections 
    for known, occupied maternity roosts for two reasons: (1) While it may 
    be unlikely, in cases where a tree was about to be removed, but was 
    known to be occupied by northern long-eared bats, they would have some 
    protections while the young could not fly; and (2) we wanted known, 
    occupied maternity roosts to be given consideration because they help 
    to signal to project planners an area that is likely to be used by 
    northern long-eared bats in the future (as this species has a high 
    degree of site fidelity). We refined the protection for known, occupied 
    maternity roosts to make it as practical to implement as possible in 
    order to minimize the disincentive created for conducting surveys. Many 
    forest managers implement similar types of relatively small seasonal 
    buffers to protect other species of sensitive wildlife (e.g., around 
    nesting raptors) and therefore we do not view this provision as a real 
    disincentive to conducting surveys. Please see the Conservation Measure 
    2: Tree Removal Near Known Maternity Roost Trees section of this rule 
    for additional details. We believe that the seasonal restriction helps 
    to protect the most vulnerable life stages, in this case the non-volant 
    pups, and is adequate for the purposes of this rule.
        7. Comment: Peer reviewer(s) recommended that pregnant females 
    should be protected as part of the seasonal restriction criteria.
        Our Response: We recognize that pregnant females may be in torpor 
    or less able to flee in early spring. However, we did not have 
    information on how pregnancy in northern long-eared bats influenced the 
    degree of torpor or their ability to flee from disturbance. As 
    discussed in this rule, we expect only a small percentage of the 
    species' forested habitat to be affected by activities (e.g., tree 
    removal, prescribed fire) that might impact a pregnant northern long-
    eared bats in torpor and, therefore, we expect only small proportion of 
    the species' population to be potentially exposed to these activities. 
    Because of the relatively small exposure and uncertainty about how 
    pregnancy affects degree of torpor or ability to flee, we have not 
    expanded the seasonal protections for this purpose. We believe that 
    seasonal restrictions help protect the vulnerable pup stage, when young 
    pups cannot fly, and are adequate for the purposes of this rule.
        8. Comment: Peer reviewer(s) stated that the conservation efforts 
    will not be effective because the natural heritage data are limited 
    with respect to known maternity roost trees and hibernacula.
        Our Response: We agree that the data are limited and this can be 
    challenging from the implementation and/or project planning 
    perspective. However, we have purposefully limited protections where 
    possible, to minimize the potential disincentive to continue to survey 
    for the species. However, we anticipate that information in State 
    natural heritage data bases will continue to improve post-listing.
        9. Comment: Peer reviewer expressed concern with allowing lethal 
    take of northern long-eared bats from human dwellings.
        Our Response: We encourage the non-lethal removal of northern long-
    eared bats from human structures, preferably by excluding them outside 
    of the maternity period, whenever possible. However, because of the 
    potential for human health considerations, we have not required this as 
    part of the exception to the purposeful take prohibition. We have 
    limited this take to houses, garages, barns, sheds, and other buildings 
    designed for human entry.
    Public Comments
    
    General
    
        10. Comment: Commenters from many development sectors requested 
    that their activities be included in the suite of exempted activities 
    under the 4(d) rule (specific sectors addressed below).
        Our Response: In general, this final rule has been restructured to 
    clarify prohibitions to take rather than to rely on a list of excepted 
    activities. Prohibitions are applied in this final rule where necessary 
    and advisable for the conservation of the species. Therefore, the 
    various ``sectors'' do not need to be identified or ``excepted'' to 
    apply rule provisions.
    
    Forest Management
    
        11. Comment: Several commenters recommended that forest conversion 
    be included as an excepted activity. Comments were specific to 
    conversion of hardwood forests to pine plantations, managed pine 
    forest, pine ecosystem, and the Service's characterization of pine 
    stands as monoculture stands representing poor bat habitat.
        Our Response: Incidental take resulting from forest management, 
    including forest conversion, is not a prohibited action pursuant to 
    this final 4(d) rule provided conservation measures to protect known 
    hibernacula and known, occupied maternity roost trees are employed. 
    Please see sections above titled Forest Management and Forest 
    Conversion.
        12. Comment: Commenters stated that forest management must occur to 
    avoid habitat deterioration to poor quality bat habitat. They further 
    stated that forest health depends upon active management including tree 
    removal and clearcutting.
        Our Response: We agree that forest management can be very important 
    in creating or maintaining forest successional patterns that help to 
    ensure suitable trees are available for roosting northern long-eared 
    bats. Further, forest management can help to increase prey availability 
    or suitability of foraging habitat. Please see our discussion above 
    under Forest Management for additional details. Incidental take 
    resulting from forest management is not prohibited pursuant to this 
    final 4(d) rule provided conservation measures to protect known 
    hibernacula and known maternity roost trees are employed.
        13. Comment: Commenters suggested that the Service consider 
    exemptions for sustainable forest practices implemented under a 
    sustainable forest management plan or sustainable forestry certificate 
    program.
        Our Response: We considered incorporating other possible 
    conservation measures related to forest management and conversion. 
    However, given the overall small percentage of the species' range 
    potentially affected by
    
    [[Page 1914]]
    
    these activities in any given year, it was not clear that additional 
    conditions related to incidental take from forest management or 
    conversion would meaningfully change the conservation outlook for the 
    species. Further, adding protections with uncertain benefits, but with 
    large potential public impacts can hinder support for species 
    conservation. Incidental take resulting from forest management is not 
    prohibited pursuant to this final 4(d) rule provided conservation 
    measures to protect known hibernacula and known, occupied maternity 
    roost trees are employed.
        14. Comment: Commenters stated that the Service should focus on the 
    elimination of WNS rather than regulating timber harvest in summer 
    habitat.
        Our Response: Efforts to address the threat posed by WNS are on-
    going by the Service and many partners across the species range. 
    Incidental take resulting from forest management or forest conversion 
    is not prohibited pursuant to this final 4(d) rule provided 
    conservation measures to protect known hibernacula and known, occupied 
    maternity roost trees are employed.
        15. Comment: A commenter stated that the Service should halt 
    commercial timber harvest and another commenter suggested restricting 
    the removal of snags and coarse woody debris in areas populated by the 
    species.
        Our Response: The northern long-eared bat is not limited in terms 
    of habitat availability for feeding, breeding, and sheltering in the 
    summer (non-hibernating) months. Please see the discussions under 
    Forest Management and Forest Conversion above in this rule. We have 
    carefully considered the value of habitat protection for the species. 
    We have determined that protection of summer habitat is not required 
    for species conservation except where trees may be occupied by young, 
    non-volant (flightless) pups and for areas immediately surrounding 
    hibernacula where they swarm and feed just prior to hibernation and 
    when they emerge from hibernation in the spring. Due to this swarming 
    behavior and the vulnerability of bats when hibernating, we have 
    determined that take prohibitions are necessary and advisable in winter 
    habitat (hibernacula), where bats are subject to the effects of WNS. In 
    addition, we have determined that protection of known, occupied 
    maternity roost trees is necessary and advisable in order to protect 
    young pups.
        16. Comment: The Service should increase protections to avoid 
    impacts to bats from the point that they emerge from hibernation to the 
    end of the maternity/pup season. Forest management should only be done 
    in a manner that retains sufficient vegetative cover and protects 
    northern long-eared bats at the maternity colony level.
        Our Response: We considered incorporating other possible 
    conservation measures related to forest management and conversion. 
    However, given the overall small percentage of the species' range 
    potentially affected by these activities in any given year, it was not 
    clear that additional conditions related to the incidental take from 
    forest management or conversion would meaningfully change the 
    conservation outlook for the species. Further, adding protections with 
    uncertain benefits, but with large potential public impacts can hinder 
    support for the species conservation. We have determined that 
    protection of known, occupied maternity roost trees during the months 
    of June and July is an adequate conservation measure for the protection 
    of non-volant pups.
        17. Comment: Commenter(s) suggested an exemption for invasive 
    species management in forested landscapes.
        Our Response: Outside of hibernacula, this final rule does not 
    prohibit take from activities other than tree removal. Therefore, 
    incidental take associated with management of invasive species using 
    pesticides or other interventions is not prohibited. Where intervention 
    involves tree removal, conservation measures must be followed to comply 
    with this rule. However, entities that cannot apply the required 
    conservation measures have other means to have take excepted, such as 
    section 10 permits or section 7 incidental take authorization.
    
    Human Structures
    
        18. Comment: Commenters suggested expansion of the definition of 
    human structures/dwellings to include bridges, culverts, cattle passes, 
    and other human-made structures.
        Our Response: This final rule does not prohibit direct take of 
    northern long-eared bats occupying human structures defined as houses, 
    garages, barns, sheds, and other buildings designed for human entry. 
    While we encourage landowners and project proponents to find other 
    mechanisms to avoid killing or injuring bats that occupy bridges, 
    culverts, and other structures, incidental take is not prohibited by 
    this rule. While bridge and culvert use for the species has been 
    documented, it is relatively uncommon compared to tree or other types 
    of roost sites (e.g., barns) and, therefore, did not warrant specific 
    provisions in this final rule. Within the WNS zone, however, project 
    proponents must apply conservation measures to avoid habitat removal 
    around hibernacula and to avoid cutting or destroying known, occupied 
    maternity roost trees or any other trees within a 150-foot radius from 
    the maternity roost tree during June and July.
        19. Comment: Commenters stated that take of northern long-eared bat 
    in human dwellings should not be exempted and requested that the 
    Service provide rationale for determining that this exemption is 
    necessary.
        Our Response: We encourage the non-lethal removal of northern long-
    eared bats from human structures whenever possible, preferably by 
    excluding them from the structure outside of the maternity period. 
    However, because of the potential for human health considerations, we 
    have not required this as part of the exception to the purposeful take 
    prohibition. Please see the discussion under Exceptions to the 
    Purposeful Take Prohibition in this rule for additional details. Take 
    of northern long-eared bats to remove them from human structures is not 
    prohibited.
    
    Hazardous Tree Removal
    
        20. Comment: Several comments requested clarification and/or 
    expansion of the exception to take for removal of hazardous trees.
        Our Response: Our intent is to provide for the removal of hazardous 
    trees for the protection of human life and property. This is not the 
    same as hazard tree removal within the context of forest management or 
    rights-of-way management where hazard trees are identified as trees 
    that are in danger of falling. Incidental take of northern long-eared 
    bats from hazardous tree removal in the context of rights-of-way 
    management is not prohibited by the final 4(d) rule provided 
    conservation measures to protect known hibernacula and known, occupied 
    maternity roost trees are applied.
    
    Minimal Tree Removal
    
        21. Comment: Several commenters requested that minimal tree removal 
    be expanded to a larger acreage.
        Our Response: Conversion of forested cover to alternate uses is not 
    prohibited under this final rule, provided that conservation measures 
    are followed when those activities occur within the WNS zone. For a 
    discussion of this issue, please see Forest Conversion section in this 
    rule.
        22. Comment: Several commenters stated that the exemption for 
    minimal tree removal should be expanded to other (non-forest) industry 
    entities and should include all activities that have a
    
    [[Page 1915]]
    
    minimal effect on the northern long-eared bat.
        Our Response: Conversion of forested acreages to alternate uses is 
    not prohibited under this final rule, provided that conservation 
    measures are followed. This is applicable to all entities that may 
    engage in activities that remove trees or convert forested acres. See 
    the Forest Conversion section in this rule.
    
    Oil and Gas Industry
    
        23. Comment: A number of commenters from the oil and gas industry 
    stated that the industry should be included within exemptions from take 
    prohibitions because: (1) Their impact on northern long-eared bat 
    habitat is small compared to forest management impacts; (2) habitat is 
    re-vegetated following pipeline installation; (3) oil and gas 
    exploration and transport are not the stated primary threat to the 
    species (WNS is the primary threat); and (4) adequate regulatory 
    mechanisms exist for mitigating industry environmental impacts.
        Our Response: Take of northern long-eared bats attributable to 
    habitat conversion and habitat loss is not prohibited under this final 
    4(d) rule, provided that developers and project proponents follow 
    conservation measures described herein when activities occur within the 
    WNS zone. See the Forest Conversion section in this rule.
    
    Rights-of-Way
    
        24. Comment: Commenter(s) stated that loss of habitat attributable 
    to clearing for linear projects is miniscule compared to habitat 
    conversion due to forest management.
        Our Response: Incidental take attributable to maintenance, 
    development, and rights-of-way expansion is not prohibited by this 
    final 4(d) rule, provided conservation measures contained herein are 
    followed when activities occur within the WNS zone.
        25. Comment: Commenter(s) stated that the exception, as proposed 
    and implemented via the interim rule, should be expanded to greater 
    than 100-feet and should be clarified.
        Our Response: Incidental take attributable to maintenance, 
    development, and rights-of-way expansion is not prohibited by this 
    final 4(d) rule, provided conservation measures contained herein are 
    followed when activities occur within the WNS zone.
        26. Comment: Commenter(s) stated that the exception for rights-of-
    way should be expanded to include new rights-of-way and transmission 
    corridors.
        Our Response: Incidental take attributable to maintenance, 
    development, and rights-of-way expansion is not prohibited by this 
    final 4(d) rule, provided conservation measures contained herein are 
    followed when activities occur within the WNS zone.
        27. Comment: Commenter(s) disagree with the Service's assertion 
    that vegetation removal within or adjacent to rights-of-way is a small-
    scale alteration of habitat.
        Our Response: It is within the context of the species range and 
    potential for available habitat that right-of-way development, 
    maintenance or expansion are small scale alterations of forest habitat. 
    The extent of conversion from forest to other land cover types has been 
    fairly consistent with conversion to forest (cropland reversion/
    plantings). Further, the recent past and projected amounts of forest 
    loss to conversion from all sources was and is anticipated to be only a 
    small percentage of the total amount of forest habitat. For example by 
    2060, 4 to 8 percent of forest area found in 2007 across the 
    conterminous United States is expected to be lost (U.S Forest Service 
    2012, p. 12). We have not broadened the incidental prohibition related 
    to habitat loss because WNS is the predominant threat to the species. 
    Summer habitat does not now or in the future appear likely to be a 
    limiting factor for the species; therefore, we have focused the 
    protections on vulnerable individuals in summer habitat and protecting 
    the winter habitat, where sensitivity to the effects of WNS is 
    heightened.
        28. Comment: Commenter(s) requested that the Service expand the 
    rights-of-way exemption to include access roads and infrastructure 
    required to deliver services.
        Our Response: Incidental take attributable to maintenance, 
    development, and rights-of-way expansion is not prohibited by this 
    final 4(d) rule, provided conservation measures contained herein are 
    followed when activities occur within the WNS zone. This includes 
    related activities such as access road clearing and facilities related 
    to delivery of services. In the case where tree removal is the activity 
    in question, incidental take is not prohibited provided that the 
    conservation measures herein are followed when those activities occur 
    within the WNS zone.
        29. Comment: Commenter suggested that the final 4(d) rule should 
    prohibit all tree clearing activities related to the maintenance, 
    repair, and creation of rights-of-way.
        Our Response: The northern long-eared bat is not limited in terms 
    of habitat availability for feeding, breeding, and sheltering in the 
    summer (non-hibernating) months. We have carefully considered the value 
    of habitat protection for the species. We have determined that 
    protection of summer habitat is not required for species conservation 
    except where trees are known to be occupied by northern long-eared bats 
    when the young are non-volant (flightless) and for areas immediately 
    surrounding hibernacula where they swarm and feed just prior to 
    hibernation and when they emerge from hibernation in the spring.
    
    Solar Energy
    
        30. Comment: Commenter(s) requested that solar energy development 
    be provided an exemption under the 4(d) rule.
        Our Response: Solar energy developers will need to consider the 
    impacts of their development and operations in light of the 
    prohibitions of this rule. Incidental take outside of the WNS zone is 
    not prohibited. Incidental take from tree-removal activities within the 
    WNS zone is prohibited under specific conditions related to known 
    hibernacula and known, occupied maternity roost trees (see Activities 
    Involving Tree Removal section above for details).
    
    Agriculture
    
        31. Comment: Commenter(s) requested that agricultural activities be 
    included in the suite of exempted activities under the 4(d) rule.
        Our Response: We have substantially revised the prohibitions and 
    exceptions in this final rule that may apply to agricultural 
    activities. Agricultural producers/operators will need to consider the 
    impacts of their activities in light of the prohibitions of this rule. 
    Incidental take outside of the WNS zone is not prohibited. Incidental 
    take from tree removal activities within the WNS zone is prohibited 
    under specific conditions related to known hibernacula and known, 
    occupied maternity roost trees (see Activities Involving Tree Removal, 
    above, for details). This final rule has been restructured in a manner 
    that it applies prohibitions where necessary and advisable for 
    conservation of the species. Therefore, agricultural development and 
    operations do not need to be specifically ``excepted'' in order to 
    apply the rule's provisions.
    
    [[Page 1916]]
    
    Caves and Mines
    
        32. Comment: Commenter(s) requested an exemption for show caves and 
    cave tours.
        Our Response: Hibernating bats are very sensitive to disturbance as 
    discussed in greater detail under the Hibernacula section of this 
    document. This final rule prohibits the incidental take of northern 
    long-eared bats in hibernacula inside the WNS zone as well as the 
    purposeful take (e.g., purposefully harassing or killing) of northern 
    long-eared bats in hibernacula both inside and outside of the WNS zone. 
    When this species occupies caves or mines used by people regardless of 
    the purpose, the provisions of this 4(d) rule apply. Show cave or mine 
    activities inside the WNS zone that do not result in the incidental 
    take of northern long-eared bats are not prohibited. In other words, if 
    northern long-eared bats are not being disrupted from their normal 
    hibernation behaviors (e.g., by avoiding areas with hibernating bats, 
    limiting noise and lighting in areas used by bats), we do not consider 
    human use of the cave or mine to be a ``take'' of the bats.
        33. Comment: Commenter(s) stated that an exemption should be made 
    available for mining, mineral exploration, and coal extraction 
    activities.
        Our Response: Incidental take of northern long-eared bats that 
    results from tree-removal activity, including mining operations, is 
    prohibited in some circumstances (see Activities Involving Tree 
    Removal, above). However, hibernating bats are very sensitive to 
    disturbance, as discussed in greater detail under the Hibernacula 
    section of this rule. This final rule prohibits the incidental take of 
    northern long-eared bats in hibernacula inside the WNS zone as well as 
    the purposeful take (e.g., purposefully harassing or killing) of 
    northern long-eared bats in hibernacula both inside and outside of the 
    WNS zone. Inside the WNS zone, the take of northern long-eared bats in 
    mines and man-made tunnels for mineral or coal extraction includes any 
    activity that kills, injures, harms, or harasses the species. Mining, 
    mineral exploration, and coal extraction activities will need to work 
    with the Service to find alternative means to authorize take, such as 
    through a section 10 permitting process or section 7 process where 
    applicable. Mining activities inside the WNS zone that do not result in 
    the incidental take of northern long-eared bats are not prohibited. In 
    other words, if northern long-eared bats are not being killed, injured, 
    or otherwise disrupted from their normal hibernation behaviors by the 
    mining operations, we do not consider those activities to be a ``take'' 
    of the bats.
        34. Comment: Commenter(s) suggested that activities designed to re-
    claim abandoned mines or maintain cave environments for the benefit of 
    wildlife species should be exempt under the 4(d) rule.
        Our Response: We agree that beneficial reclamation and maintenance 
    should be encouraged. However, exception from take prohibitions through 
    a species-specific 4(d) rule is not the appropriate mechanism for 
    authorizing this activity. Where abandoned mines and cave environments 
    are in use by northern long-eared bats, take associated with 
    maintenance is prohibited; however, we encourage project proponents to 
    work with the Service to implement best management practices to avoid 
    or minimize the effects of their actions in the interest of habitat 
    improvement. We will work with project proponents to determine 
    alternate ways to authorize activities, such as section 10 permits or 
    section 7 incidental take authorization.
    
    Mosquito Control
    
        35. Comment: Commenter challenges the Service's assertion that 
    chemicals used in mosquito control (malathion and others of comparable 
    risk to mammals) pose a risk to northern long-eared bats; commenter 
    further requests an exemption for mosquito control activities, 
    especially where there is a public health risk.
        Our Response: Please see the Environmental Contaminants section of 
    this rule for details concerning our evaluation of the risks from 
    pesticide applications. After careful consideration of the available 
    information, we do not include in this rule a prohibition on the 
    incidental take of northern long-eared bats as result of pesticide 
    application provided the application is a ``lawful activity,'' that is, 
    it must comply all applicable State laws. Any northern long-eared bat 
    unlawfully taken pursuant to a State pesticide law would be a violation 
    of this final 4(d) rule.
    Adequacy and Clarity of 0.25 Mile Hibernacula Buffer
        36. Comment: Commenter(s) suggested that this buffer is too 
    restrictive for landowners.
        Our Response: The Service has determined that a protective buffer 
    around known hibernacula is necessary and advisable for the 
    conservation of the species. Please see the discussion under 
    Conservation Measure 1: Tree Removal Near Known Northern Long-eared Bat 
    Hibernacula of this rule for our explanation of the need for this 
    buffer. As described in that section, we have prohibited incidental 
    take of northern long-eared bats under specific tree-removal 
    circumstances; however, that does not mean that all activities 
    involving tree-removal activities within the 0.25-mile (0.4-km) buffer 
    of hibernacula will result in take. For example, a timber harvest might 
    be conducted within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of a hibernaculum at a time 
    when bats are unlikely to be roosting in trees within the buffer (e.g., 
    winter) that fully protects any bats in the hibernaculum as well as the 
    hibernaculum's suitability for bats (i.e., bat's access, microclimate), 
    and does not significantly change the suitability of the habitat for 
    foraging by northern long-eared bats or perhaps even improves prey 
    availability. In such a case, the timber harvest, although closer than 
    0.25 miles (0.4 km) to the hibernaculum, is not likely to result in 
    incidental take, so we would not recommend that the timber harvester 
    seek authorization for incidental take pursuant to the Act. Further, 
    while incidental take of northern long-eared bats within that buffer is 
    prohibited (in the WNS zone), it may be authorized on a case-by-case 
    basis with further coordination with the Service at a local level. Take 
    may be authorized through section 10 or section 7 of the Act. In 
    addition, it is our expectation that project modifications may be made 
    that would protect the hibernaculum and allow for the project 
    proponent's objectives to be met.
        37. Comment: Commenter(s) seek clarification on whether the buffer 
    and prohibition to clearcutting (within the buffer) is a year-round 
    restriction.
        Our Response: Yes, the protection of the hibernaculum and a buffer 
    around it is a year round protective measure and applies to all types 
    of tree-removal activities in the WNS zone.
        38. Comment: Commenter(s) suggested that the buffer around 
    hibernacula be limited to fall swarming and spring emergence when 
    northern long-eared bats are present.
        Our Response: We have determined that protective measures must be 
    considered year-round for several reasons, including that habitat lost 
    outside of the spring emergence and fall swarming period could affect 
    the suitability of those habitats later during spring emergence or fall 
    swarming. Further, we have included the buffer on hibernacula for 
    several reasons beyond protecting foraging habitat during fall swarming 
    and spring emergence. In particular, the buffer will help to protect 
    the micro-climate characteristics of
    
    [[Page 1917]]
    
    hibernacula and other entrances used by bats that may not be reflected 
    in the primary location information for hibernacula. For example, many 
    caves or abandoned mines used may have entrances used by bats that are 
    not reflected in the general location information for those sites that 
    are used by people; a buffer helps to protect less prominent features 
    that may be important to bats. Projects may be able to be planned or 
    modified within those buffer areas to retain sufficient habitat and 
    avoid harm; however, the Service considers coordination on a case-by-
    case basis to be important to assure necessary conservation.
        39. Comment: Several commenter(s) suggested an increased buffer 
    area around hibernacula would be more appropriate.
        Our Response: We have revised the approach used in this final 4(d) 
    rule to ensure that hibernating northern long-eared bats in the WNS 
    zone are protected from incidental take independent of the buffer size 
    used in the conservation measure. In addition, all northern long-eared 
    bats both inside and outside of the WNS zone are protected from 
    purposeful take (e.g., killing or intentionally harassing northern 
    long-eared bats), including while in hibernacula where they are most 
    vulnerable. We have retained the 0.25-mile buffer (0.25-mile radius 
    from known hibernacula entrance/access points used by bats) to further 
    protect the hibernacula and associated forested habitat for several 
    reasons (see discussion above under Conservation Measure 1: Tree 
    Removal Near Known Northern Long-eared Bat Hibernacula).
        40. Comment: Commenter(s) expressed concern with implementing 
    measures when they do not have data/information on known hibernacula.
        Our Response: The Service recognizes the challenges associated with 
    data sharing and data management. Many states share data management 
    concerns and guard data carefully. We encourage landowners to continue 
    to work with your State natural resources and natural heritage staff to 
    evaluate your ownership for the presence of these important resources. 
    When seeking information on the presence of hibernacula within your 
    project boundary, our expectation is that a project proponent will 
    complete due diligence to determine available data. However, if 
    information is not available, we recognize that the project proponent 
    that has made reasonable efforts to determine whether there are known 
    hibernacula on the property is in the position of not knowing if no 
    data have been provided.
    Maternity Roost Tree Restrictions
        41. Comment: Commenter(s) expressed concerns about having adequate 
    information to identify maternity roost trees.
        Our Response: We recognize the challenges associated with data 
    sharing. Please see response to Comment 40. While not required by this 
    rule, the Service recommends summer surveys to definitively locate 
    maternity roost trees.
        42. Comment: Commenter(s) requested that we clarify that roost 
    trees means maternity roost trees.
        Our Response: We have made this final 4(d) rule specific to 
    maternity roost trees.
        43. Comment: Commenter(s) expressed disagreement with the 0.25 mile 
    buffer around known, occupied roost trees. Some commented that this 
    buffer was too small, while some commented that it was too large.
        Our Response: In the interim 4(d) rule (80 FR 17974; April 2, 
    2015), the buffer around known, occupied roost trees applied only to 
    some types of tree-removal activities (e.g., forest management, rights-
    of-ways, prairie management) and excluded only clearcuts (and similar 
    harvest methods). Given the relatively small percent of forest habitat 
    anticipated to be impacted by forest management or conversion (see 
    Forest Management and Forest Conversion, above of this rule for more 
    details), we revised the buffer around the known maternity roost trees. 
    As explained in more detail under Conservation Measure 2: Tree Removal 
    Near Known Maternity Roost Trees, we have made the buffer more broadly 
    applicable to all tree-removal activities, but have narrowed it in size 
    to provide protection for the maternity roost tree, while minimizing 
    the potential that the protective measure would serve as impediment to 
    conducting new surveys. We have reduced the buffer around known, 
    occupied maternity roost trees to a radius of 150 feet around the 
    known, occupied maternity roost tree.
        44. Comment: Commenter(s) stated that the Service should require 
    surveys to determine where roost trees are located.
        Our Response: The Act does not require a private landowner to 
    survey his or her property to determine whether endangered or 
    threatened wildlife and plants occupy their land. We encourage 
    landowners to voluntarily seek additional information to conserve 
    natural resources in their land use/land management actions; however, 
    we will not require surveys to locate northern long-eared bats and 
    maternity roost trees on private property.
    
    Residential Housing Development
    
        45. Comment: Commenter(s) requested that northern long-eared bat 
    take be excepted for the purposes of residential housing development.
        Our Response: Take resulting from removal of summer habitat (tree 
    removal) is not prohibited provided the conservation measures set forth 
    in this rule are followed when the habitat removal occurs within the 
    WNS zone. The provisions of this final rule have been restructured to 
    clarify prohibitions rather than rely on a list of excepted activities.
    
    Wind Energy Development
    
        46. Comment: Commenter(s) requested that northern long-eared bat 
    take be excepted for the purposes of renewable energy development and 
    operation (wind energy).
        Our Response: Incidental take resulting from wind energy 
    development and operation is not prohibited, provided that the 
    conservation measures set forth in this rule are followed to protect 
    hibernacula and known, occupied maternity roost trees. We strongly 
    encourage voluntary conservation measures and best management practices 
    such as feathering or elevated cut-in speeds to reduce impacts to 
    northern long-eared bats and other bats; however, we have not 
    prohibited incidental take attributable to wind energy in this final 
    rule. Please see the Wind Energy Facilities section of this rule for 
    additional details.
    
    Natural Resource Management
    
        47. Comment: Commenter(s) requested that northern long-eared bat 
    take be excepted when activities are included in Department of Defense 
    integrated natural resource management plans, providing for activities 
    such as recreational activities, burns, and other temporary but 
    insignificant effects on the northern long-eared bat.
        Our Response: Incidental take resulting from activities described 
    as recreational activities and beneficial wildlife habitat management/
    maintenance is not prohibited, provided that the conservation measures 
    set forth in this rule are followed when the activity occurs inside the 
    WNS zone. We have completed a section 7 analysis on the provisions of 
    this final 4(d) rule to ensure that actions completed in accordance 
    with the final rule are not likely to jeopardize the continued 
    existence of the species. Where these resource management activities do 
    not fit within the final rule, section 7 consultation would need to be
    
    [[Page 1918]]
    
    completed to authorize incidental take of the northern long-eared bat.
    
    Compliance and Monitoring
    
        48. Comment: Commenter(s) recommended that surveys be required and 
    that landowners be required to report on their activities in order to 
    receive the benefits of the 4(d) rule.
        Our Response: While we welcome landowners' efforts to determine 
    where bats may be located on their property, the Act does not require 
    that a landowner survey his or her property to find species. We are not 
    mandating that surveys be completed as part of this rule.
    
    Alternate Section 4(d) Provisional Language
    
        49. Comment: One organization commented on behalf of its members 
    and 14 other environmental organizations (collectively referenced as 
    ``the Center'') in support of the adoption of a different 4(d) rule and 
    in opposition of the Service's proposed and the interim 4(d) rules.
        Our Response: The remaining paragraphs (under the heading Summary 
    of Comments and Recommendations on the Proposed and Interim4(d) Rules) 
    pertain to the comments we received from the Center. With respect to 
    the overarching comment that our 4(d) rule does not conserve the 
    species, we believe that our final 4(d) rule provides for the 
    ``necessary and advisable'' conservation of the species, as described 
    herein. For further information, please see our Determination section, 
    below.
        With respect to the Center's proposed 4(d) language, we note that 
    the proposed language defines specific prohibitions and would make a 
    regulatory determination of ``take'' to include a number of actions. 
    These include cave and mine entry without implementing decontamination 
    protocols; transporting equipment into caves and mines or between caves 
    and mines between the WNS zone and non-WNS zone; cave and mine entry 
    during hibernation periods; activities associated with hydraulic 
    fracturing within 5 miles of a hibernaculum, within 1.5 miles of an 
    occupied roost tree, or within 3 miles of an acoustic detection or bat 
    capture record; noise disturbance activities within a 0.5-mile radius 
    of a hibernaculum during the hibernation period; and disruption of 
    water sources within hibernacula. With respect to protection of 
    hibernacula, take of northern long-eared bats is prohibited. 
    Establishing the causal connection between a variety of activities such 
    as those the Center proposed to be defined as prohibitions is beyond 
    the scope of this rule. We have addressed hibernacula protection 
    provisions in this rule under the section entitled Conservation Measure 
    1: Tree Removal Near Known Northern Long-eared Bat Hibernacula. 
    Protections in this final rule are adequate to protect the species.
        In addition to the Center's suggested language for hibernacula 
    prohibitions, they recommended language regarding prohibitions for 
    prescribed burning and aerial spraying. Based on our analysis, we 
    conclude that prescribed burning and aerial spraying do not have a 
    measurable population-level impact on the species and regulation of 
    those activities will not meaningfully impact the species' ability to 
    recover. For further information on prescribed fire impacts, see 
    Prescribed Fire above. For further information on aerial spraying of 
    pesticides, please see the Environmental Contaminants section above.
        The final prohibition suggested by the Center was the operation of 
    utility-scale wind projects, specifically during the hours from dusk to 
    sunrise during the fall swarming season, at low wind speeds, and within 
    5 miles of a hibernaculum. Incidental take resulting from the operation 
    of wind energy facilities is not prohibited by this final 4(d) rule and 
    a complete discussion of known impacts to the species may be found in 
    the Wind Energy Facilities section above.
        Finally, the Center provided suggested regulatory text for 
    exemptions from prohibitions that included language for seasonal 
    restrictions, clearing restrictions, mandatory measures for hibernacula 
    protection (gate installation), water quality protection measures, and 
    data collection and reporting requirements. We recognize the effort 
    that has gone into the development of this alternative language. 
    However, we have carefully considered the measures that are necessary 
    for the protection of the species. Our final rule has been developed 
    based on the Service's desire to implement protective measures that 
    will make a meaningful impact on species conservation and recovery. As 
    stated elsewhere in this document (see Determination section, below), 
    we have provided regulatory flexibility while implementing protective 
    measures where we have determined those measures to be necessary and 
    advisable for conservation of the species.
    
    Determination
    
        Section 4(d) of the Act states that ``the Secretary shall issue 
    such regulations as she deems `necessary and advisable to provide for 
    the conservation' '' of species listed as threatened species. 
    Conservation is defined in the Act to mean ``to use and the use of all 
    methods and procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered 
    species or threatened species to the point at which the measures 
    provided pursuant to [the Act] are no longer necessary.''
        The courts have recognized the extent of the Secretary's discretion 
    under this standard to develop rules that are appropriate for the 
    conservation of a species. For example, the Secretary may find that it 
    is necessary and advisable not to include a taking prohibition, or to 
    include a limited taking prohibition. See Alsea Valley Alliance v 
    Lautenbacher, 2007 U.S. Dist. Lexis 60203 (D. Or. 2007); Washington 
    Environmental Council v. National Marine Fisheries Service, 2002 U.S. 
    Dist. Lexis 5432 (W.D. Wash. 2002). In addition, as affirmed in State 
    of Louisiana v. Verity, 853 F. 2d 322 (5th Cir. 1988), the rule need 
    not address all the threats to the species. As noted by Congress when 
    the Act was initially enacted, ``once an animal is on the threatened 
    list, the Secretary has an almost infinite number of options available 
    to him [her] with regard to the permitted activities for those species. 
    [She] may, for example, permit taking, but not importation of such 
    species,'' or she may choose to forbid both taking and importation but 
    allow the transportation of such species, as long as the prohibitions, 
    and exceptions to those prohibitions, will ``serve to conserve, 
    protect, or restore the species concerned in accordance with the 
    purposes of the Act'' (H.R. Rep. No. 412, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess. 1973).
        Section 9 prohibitions make it illegal for any person subject to 
    the jurisdiction of the United States to violate any regulation 
    pertaining to any threatened species of fish or wildlife listed 
    pursuant to section 4 of the Act and promulgated by the Secretary 
    pursuant to authority provided by the Act. Under this final 4(d) rule, 
    incidental take of the northern long-eared bat will not be prohibited 
    outside the WNS zone. Incidental take also will not it be prohibited 
    within the WNS zone, outside of hibernacula, provided that it occurs 
    more than 0.25 miles (0.4 km) from a known hibernacula and does not 
    result from an activity that cuts or destroys known occupied maternity 
    roost trees, or any other trees within a 150-foot (45-m) radius from 
    the maternity tree, during the pup season (June 1 through July 31).
        Accordingly, we have determined that this provision is necessary 
    and advisable for the conservation of the northern long-eared bat as 
    explained below.
    
    [[Page 1919]]
    
        Although not fully protective of every individual, the conservation 
    measures identified in this final rule help protect maternity colonies. 
    This final species-specific rule under section 4(d) of the Act provides 
    the flexibility for certain activities to occur that have not been the 
    cause of the species' imperilment, while still promoting conservation 
    of the species across its range.
        The northern long-eared bat was listed as a threatened species 
    under the Act, with an interim rule under section 4(d), on April 2, 
    2015 (80 FR 17974). At that time, the Service invited public comment on 
    the interim 4(d) rule for 90 days, ending July 1, 2015. The Service had 
    already received comments for 60 days on its proposed 4(d) rule (80 FR 
    2371; January 16, 2015). In total, the Service received approximately 
    40,500 comments on the proposed and interim 4(d) rules. For a complete 
    discussion of the comments, as well as the Service's response to 
    comments, see Summary of Comments and Recommendations on the Proposed 
    and Interim 4(d) Rules, above.
        Because the primary threat to the northern long-eared bat is a 
    fungal disease known as WNS, the Service has tailored the final 4(d) 
    rule to prohibit the take of northern long-eared bats from certain 
    activities within areas where they are in decline, as a result of WNS, 
    and within these areas we apply incidental take protection only to 
    known, occupied maternity roost trees and known hibernacula. These 
    protections will help to conserve the northern long-eared bat during 
    its most vulnerable life stages (from birth to flight, or volancy) and 
    during spring and fall swarming (near hibernacula).
        In summary, this 4(d) rule is necessary and advisable to provide 
    for the conservation of the northern long-eared bat because it provides 
    for protection of known maternity roost trees and known hibernacula 
    within the WNS zone. In addition, promulgation of this rule allows the 
    conservation community to provide for species conservation where it can 
    affect change, namely during the northern long-eared bat's most 
    vulnerable life stages and where hibernation occurs. This final 4(d) 
    rule allows the regulated public to manage lands in a manner that is 
    lawful and compatible with species' survival, and it allows for 
    protection of the species in a manner that the Secretary deems to be 
    necessary and advisable for the conservation of the northern long-eared 
    bat. By this rule, the Secretary deems that the prohibition of certain 
    take, which is incidental to otherwise lawful activities that take bat 
    habitat, is not necessary for the long-term survival of the species. 
    Furthermore, she acknowledges the importance of addressing the threat 
    of WNS as the primary measure to arrest and reverse the decline of the 
    species. Nothing in this 4(d) rule affects other provisions of the Act, 
    such as designation of critical habitat under section 4, recovery 
    planning under section 4(f), and consultation requirements under 
    section 7.
    
    Required Determinations
    
    Regulatory Planning and Review
    
    (Executive Orders 12866 and 13563)
        Executive Order 12866 provides that the Office of Information and 
    Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget will 
    review all significant rules. OIRA has determined that this rule is not 
    significant. Executive Order 13563 reaffirms the principles of E.O. 
    12866 while calling for improvements in the nation's regulatory system 
    to promote predictability, to reduce uncertainty, and to use the best, 
    most innovative, and least burdensome tools for achieving regulatory 
    ends. The executive order directs agencies to consider regulatory 
    approaches that reduce burdens and maintain flexibility and freedom of 
    choice for the public where these approaches are relevant, feasible, 
    and consistent with regulatory objectives. E.O. 13563 emphasizes 
    further that regulations must be based on the best available science 
    and that the rulemaking process must allow for public participation and 
    an open exchange of ideas. We have developed this final 4(d) rule in a 
    manner consistent with these requirements.
    Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.)
        Listing and status determinations under the Endangered Species Act 
    of 1973, as amended (Act; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and any prohibitions 
    or protective measures afforded the species under the Act are exempt 
    from the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA; 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., as 
    amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act 
    (SBREFA) of 1996). However, as this final 4(d) rule is being 
    promulgated following the final listing of the northern long-eared bat, 
    we evaluate whether the Regulatory Flexibility Act applies to this 
    rulemaking.
        Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, whenever an agency must 
    publish a notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must 
    prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility 
    analysis that describes the effects of the rule on small entities 
    (small businesses, small organizations, and small government 
    jurisdictions). However, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required 
    if the head of the agency certifies the rule will not have a 
    significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
    SBREFA amended the RFA to require Federal agencies to provide a 
    statement of the factual basis for certifying that the rule will not 
    have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
    entities. Thus, for a regulatory flexibility analysis to be required, 
    impacts must exceed a threshold for ``significant impact'' and a 
    threshold for a ``substantial number of small entities.'' See 5 U.S.C. 
    605(b). Based on the information that is available to us at this time, 
    we certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact 
    on a substantial number of small entities. The following discussion 
    explains our rationale.
        On April 2, 2015 (80 FR 17974), we published the final 
    determination to list the northern long-eared bat as a threatened 
    species and an interim 4(d) rule. That rule became effective on May 4, 
    2015, and the interim 4(d) rule will remain in effect until this final 
    rule becomes effective (see DATES, above). The interim 4(d) rule 
    generally applies the prohibitions of 50 CFR 17.31 and 17.32 to the 
    northern long-eared bat, which means that the interim rule, among other 
    things, prohibits the purposeful take of northern long-eared bats 
    throughout the species' range, but the interim rule includes exceptions 
    to the purposeful take prohibition. The exceptions for purposeful take 
    are: (1) In instances of removal of northern long-eared bats from human 
    structures (if actions comply with all applicable State regulations); 
    and (2) for authorized capture, handling, and related activities of 
    northern long-eared bats by individuals permitted to conduct these same 
    activities for other bat species until May 3, 2016. Under the interim 
    rule, incidental take is not prohibited outside the WNS zone if the 
    incidental take results from otherwise lawful activities. Inside the 
    WNS zone, there are exceptions for incidental take for the following 
    activities, subject to certain conditions: Implementation of forest 
    management; maintenance and expansion of existing rights-of-way and 
    transmission corridors; prairie management; minimal tree removal; and 
    removal of hazardous trees for the protection of human life and 
    property.
        This final 4(d) rule does not generally apply the prohibitions of 
    50 CFR 17.31 to the northern long-eared bat. This rule continues to 
    prohibit purposeful take of
    
    [[Page 1920]]
    
    northern long-eared bats throughout the species' range, except in 
    certain cases, including in instances of removal of northern long-eared 
    bats from human structures and for authorized capture, handling, and 
    related activities of northern long-eared bats by individuals permitted 
    to conduct these same activities for other bat species until May 3, 
    2016. After May 3, 2016, a permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) of 
    the Act is required for the capture and handling of northern long-eared 
    bats. Under this rule, incidental take is still not prohibited outside 
    the WNS zone. Within the WNS zone, incidental take is prohibited only 
    if: (1) Actions result in the incidental take of northern long-eared 
    bats in hibernacula; (2) actions result in the incidental take of 
    northern long-eared bats by altering a known hibernaculum's entrance or 
    interior environment if the alteration impairs an essential behavioral 
    pattern, including sheltering northern long-eared bats; or (3) tree-
    removal activities result in the incidental take of northern long-eared 
    bats when the activity either occurs within 0.25 mile (0.4 kilometer) 
    of a known hibernaculum, or cuts or destroys known, occupied maternity 
    roost trees or any other trees within a 150-foot (45-meter) radius from 
    the maternity roost tree during the pup season (June 1 through July 
    31). This approach allows more flexibility to affected entities and 
    individuals in conducting activities within the WNS zone. Under this 
    rule, we individually set forth prohibitions on possession and other 
    acts with unlawfully taken northern long-eared bats, and on import and 
    export of northern long-eared bats. These prohibitions were included in 
    the interim 4(d) through the general application of the prohibitions of 
    50 CFR 17.31 to the northern long-eared bat. Under this rule, take of 
    the northern long-eared bat is also not prohibited for the following: 
    Removal of hazardous trees for protection of human life and property; 
    take in defense of life; and take by an employee or agent of the 
    Service, of the National Marine Fisheries Service, or of a State 
    conservation agency that is operating a conservation program pursuant 
    to the terms of a cooperative agreement with the Service. Regarding 
    these three exceptions, take in defense of life was not included in the 
    interim 4(d) rule, but the other two exceptions were, either through 
    the general application of 50 CFR 17.31 or through a specific exception 
    included in the interim 4(d) rule. Therefore, this final 4(d) rule will 
    result in less restrictive regulations under the Act than those set 
    forth in the interim 4(d) rule.
        We completed an analysis of the forested land area that may be 
    impacted by this rulemaking. There are approximately 400,000,000 acres 
    (161,874,256 ha) of forested habitat across the range of the northern 
    long-eared bat, which includes 37 States and the District of Columbia. 
    This rule may restrict land use activities on approximately 200,000 
    acres (80,937 ha). This area constitutes less than 0.05 percent of all 
    forested habitat across the extensive range of the northern long-eared 
    bat. Any impact in this very small portion of forested habitat is not 
    expected to affect a substantial number of entities in any given 
    sector, nor result in a significant economic impact on any given 
    entity. For the above reasons, we certify that the final rule will not 
    have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
    entities. Therefore, a final regulatory flexibility analysis is not 
    required.
    Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use--Executive Order 13211
        Executive Order 13211 (Actions Concerning Regulations That 
    Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use) requires 
    agencies to prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking 
    certain actions. For reasons discussed within this final rule, we 
    believe that the rule will not have any effect on energy supplies, 
    distribution, or use. Therefore, this action is not a significant 
    energy action, and no Statement of Energy Effects is required.
    Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
        In accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 
    et seq.), we make the following findings:
        (1) This final rule will not produce a Federal mandate. In general, 
    a Federal mandate is a provision in legislation, statute, or regulation 
    that would impose an enforceable duty upon State, local, or Tribal 
    governments, or the private sector, and includes both ``Federal 
    intergovernmental mandates'' and ``Federal private sector mandates.'' 
    These terms are defined in 2 U.S.C. 658(5)-(7). ``Federal 
    intergovernmental mandate'' includes a regulation that ``would impose 
    an enforceable duty upon State, local, or [T]ribal governments'' with 
    two exceptions. It excludes ``a condition of Federal assistance.'' It 
    also excludes ``a duty arising from participation in a voluntary 
    Federal program,'' unless the regulation ``relates to a then-existing 
    Federal program under which $500,000,000 or more is provided annually 
    to State, local, and [T]ribal governments under entitlement 
    authority,'' if the provision would ``increase the stringency of 
    conditions of assistance'' or ``place caps upon, or otherwise decrease, 
    the Federal Government's responsibility to provide funding,'' and the 
    State, local, or Tribal governments ``lack authority'' to adjust 
    accordingly. At the time of enactment, these entitlement programs were: 
    Medicaid; AFDC work programs; Child Nutrition; Food Stamps; Social 
    Services Block Grants; Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants; Foster 
    Care, Adoption Assistance, and Independent Living; Family Support 
    Welfare Services; and Child Support Enforcement. ``Federal private 
    sector mandate'' includes a regulation that ``would impose an 
    enforceable duty upon the private sector, except (i) a condition of 
    Federal assistance or (ii) a duty arising from participation in a 
    voluntary Federal program.''
        (2) This final 4(d) rule will result in less restrictive 
    regulations under the Act, as it pertains to the northern long-eared 
    bat, than would otherwise exist without a 4(d) rule or under the 
    interim 4(d) rule. As a result, we do not believe that this rule will 
    significantly or uniquely affect small government entities. Therefore, 
    a Small Government Agency Plan is not required.
    Takings
        In accordance with Executive Order 12630, this final rule will not 
    have significant takings implications. We have determined that the rule 
    has no potential takings of private property implications as defined by 
    this Executive Order because this 4(d) rule will result in less-
    restrictive regulations under the Act than would otherwise exist. A 
    takings implication assessment is not required.
    Federalism
        In accordance with Executive Order 13132, this final 4(d) rule does 
    not have significant Federalism effects. A federalism summary impact 
    statement is not required. This rule will not have substantial direct 
    effects on the State, on the relationship between the Federal 
    Government and the State, or on the distribution of power and 
    responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    Civil Justice Reform
        In accordance with Executive Order 12988, the Office of the 
    Solicitor has determined that this final rule does not unduly burden 
    the judicial system and meets the requirements of sections 3(a) and 
    3(b)(2) of the Order.

        This rule does not contain collections of information that require 
    approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the 
    Paperwork Reduction Act. This rule will not impose recordkeeping or 
    reporting requirements on State or local governments, individuals, 
    businesses, or organizations. An agency may not conduct or sponsor and 
    a person is not required to respond to a collection of information 
    unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.)
        We have prepared a final environmental assessment, as defined under 
    the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. For 
    information on how to obtain a copy of the final environmental 
    assessment, see ADDRESSES, above. The final environmental assessment 
    will also be available on the Internet at <http://www.regulations.gov>

    Government-to-Government Relationship With Tribes
        In accordance with the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994 
    (Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal 
    Governments; 59 FR 22951), Executive Order 13175 (Consultation and 
    Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments), and the Department of the 
    Interior's manual at 512 DM 2, we readily acknowledge our 
    responsibility to communicate meaningfully with recognized Federal 
    Tribes on a government-to-government basis. In accordance with 
    Secretarial Order 3206 of June 5, 1997 (American Indian Tribal Rights, 
    Federal-Tribal Trust Responsibilities, and the Endangered Species Act), 
    we readily acknowledge our responsibilities to work directly with 
    tribes in developing programs for healthy ecosystems, to acknowledge 
    that tribal lands are not subject to the same controls as Federal 
    public lands, to remain sensitive to Indian culture, and to make 
    information available to tribes.
        In October 2013, Tribes and multi-tribal organizations were sent 
    letters inviting them to begin consultation and coordination with the 
    service on the proposal to list the northern long-eared bat. In August 
    2014, several Tribes and multi-tribal organizations were sent an 
    additional letter regarding the Service's intent to extend the deadline 
    for making a final listing determination by 6 months. A conference call 
    was also held with Tribes to explain the listing process and discuss 
    any concerns. Following publication of the proposed rule, the Service 
    established three interagency teams (biology of the northern long-eared 
    bat, non-WNS threats, and conservation measures) to ensure that States, 
    Tribes, and other Federal agencies were able to provide input into 
    various aspects of the listing rule and potential conservation measures 
    for the species. Invitations for inclusion in these teams were sent to 
    Tribes within the range of the northern long-eared bat and a few tribal 
    representatives participated on those teams. Two additional conference 
    calls (in January and March 2015) were held with Tribes to outline the 
    proposed species-specific 4(d) rule and to answer questions. Through 
    this coordination, some Tribal representatives expressed concern about 
    how listing the northern long-eared bat may impact forestry practices, 
    housing development programs, and other activities on Tribal lands.

    Sec.  17.40  Special rules--mammals.
    
    * * * * *
        (o) Northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis). The 
    provisions of this rule are based upon the occurrence of white-nose 
    syndrome (WNS), a disease affecting many U.S. bat populations. The term 
    ``WNS zone'' identifies the set of counties within the range of the 
    northern long-eared bat within 150 miles of the boundaries of U.S. 
    counties or Canadian districts where the fungus Pseudogymnoascus 
    destructans (Pd) or WNS has been detected. For current information 
    regarding the WNS zone, contact your local Service ecological services 
    field office. Field office contact information may be obtained from the 
    Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed in 50 CFR 
    2.2.
        (1) Prohibitions. The following prohibitions apply to the northern 
    long-eared bat:
        (i) Purposeful take of northern long-eared bat, including capture, 
    handling, or other activities.
        (ii) Within the WNS zone:
        (A) Actions that result in the incidental take of northern long-
    eared bats in known hibernacula.
        (B) Actions that result in the incidental take of northern long-
    eared bats by altering a known hibernaculum's entrance or interior 
    environment if it impairs an essential behavioral pattern, including 
    sheltering northern long-eared bats.
        (C) Tree-removal activities that result in the incidental take of 
    northern long-eared bats when the activity:
        (1) Occurs within 0.25 mile (0.4 kilometer) of a known 
    hibernaculum; or
        (2) Cuts or destroys known occupied maternity roost trees, or any 
    other trees within a 150-foot (45-meter) radius from the maternity 
    roost tree, during the pup season (June 1 through July 31).
        (iii) Possession and other acts with unlawfully taken northern 
    long-eared bats. It is unlawful to possess, sell, deliver, carry, 
    transport, or ship, by any means whatsoever, any northern long-eared 
    bat that was taken in violation of this section or State laws.
        (iv) Import and export.
        (2) Exceptions from prohibitions. (i) Any person may take a 
    northern long-eared bat in defense of his own life or the lives of 
    others, including for public health monitoring purposes.
        (ii) Any person may take a northern long-eared bat that results 
    from the removal of hazardous trees for the protection of human life 
    and property.
        (iii) Any person may take a northern long-eared bat by removing it 
    from human structures, but only if the actions comply with all 
    applicable State regulations.
        (iv) Purposeful take that results from actions relating to capture, 
    handling, and related activities for northern long-eared bats by 
    individuals permitted to
    
    [[Page 1922]]
    
    conduct these same activities for other species of bat until May 3, 
    2016.
        (v) All of the provisions of Sec.  17.32 apply to the northern 
    long-eared bat.
        (vi) Any employee or agent of the Service, of the National Marine 
    Fisheries Service, or of a State conservation agency that is operating 
    a conservation program pursuant to the terms of a cooperative agreement 
    with the Service in accordance with section 6(c) of the Act, who is 
    designated by his agency for such purposes, may, when acting in the 
    course of his official duties, take northern long-eared bats covered by 
    an approved cooperative agreement to carry out conservation programs.
