    Synopsis
    
        As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
    3507), the Commission is notifying the public that it received 
    emergency approval from OMB on December 10, 2015 for the revised 
    information collection requirements contained in the information 
    collection 3060-0995, Section 1.2105(c), Bidding Application and 
    Certification Procedures; Sections 1.2105(c) and Section 1.2205, 
    Prohibition of Certain Communications.
        Under 5 CFR 1320, an agency may not conduct or sponsor a collection 
    of information unless it displays a current, valid OMB Control Number.
        No person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply 
    with a collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
    that does not display a current, valid OMB Control Number. The OMB 
    Control Number is 3060-0995. The foregoing document is required by the 
    Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-13, October 1, 1995, and 
    44 U.S.C. 3507.
        The total annual reporting burdens and costs for the respondents 
    are as follows:

        Title: Section 1.2105(c), Bidding Application and Certification 
    Procedures; Sections 1.2105(c) and Section 1.2205, Prohibition of

        Total Annual Burden: 50 hours.
        Total Annual Cost: $9,000.
        Privacy Act Impact Assessment: No impact(s).
        Nature and Extent of Confidentiality: The Commission will take all 
    reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of all Commission-held 
    data of a reverse auction applicant consistent with the confidentiality 
    requirements of the Spectrum Act and the Commission's rules. See 47 
    U.S.C. 1452(a)(3); 47 CFR 1.2206. In addition, to the extent necessary, 
    a full power or Class A television broadcast licensee may request 
    confidential treatment of any report of a prohibited communication 
    submitted to the Commission that is not already being treated as 
    confidential pursuant to section 0.459 of the Commission's rules. See 
    47 CFR 0.459. Forward auction applicants are entitled to request 
    confidentiality in accordance with section 0.459 of the Commission's 
    rules, 47 CFR 0.459.
        Needs and Uses: In the Broadcast Incentive Auction Report and 
    Order, Expanding the Economic and Innovation Opportunities of Spectrum 
    Through Incentive Auctions, FCC 14-50, the Commission adopted a new 
    rule for forward auction applicants prohibiting certain communications 
    in the context of the television broadcast incentive auction (BIA), and 
    amended an existing rule to require forward auction applicants that 
    make or receive a communication that is prohibited under the new rule 
    to file a report of such a communication with the Commission. See 47 
    CFR 1.2105(c)(4), 1.2105(c)(6). Subsequently, as a result of amendments 
    to various other provisions in section 1.2105(c) adopted in the Part 1 
    Report and Order, the new rule for forward auction applicants 
    prohibiting certain communications in the context of the BIA and the 
    amended reporting requirement for forward auction applicants were 
    redesignated as 1.2105(c)(4) and 1.2105(c)(6), respectively, without 
    any changes to the scope or substance of either rule. See 47 CFR 
    1.2105(c)(4), 1.2105(c)(6). The Commission's rules prohibiting certain 
    communications in Commission auctions are designed to reinforce 
    existing antitrust laws, facilitate detection of collusive conduct, and 
    deter anticompetitive behavior, without being so strict as to 
    discourage procompetitive arrangements between
    
    [[Page 397]]
    
    auction participants. They also help assure participants that the 
    auction process will be fair and objective, and not subject to 
    collusion. The revised information collection implements the modified, 
    BIA-specific rule in section 1.2105(c)(4) by making clear the 
    responsibility of parties who receive information that potentially 
    violates the rules to promptly submit a report notifying the 
    Commission, thereby helping the Commission enforce the prohibition on 
    covered parties, and further assuring incentive auction participants 
    that the auction process will be fair and competitive. The prohibited 
    communication reporting requirement required of covered parties will 
    enable the Commission to ensure that no bidder gains an unfair 
    advantage over other bidders in its auctions and thus enhances the 
    competitiveness and fairness of Commission's auctions. The information 
    collected will be reviewed and, if warranted, referred to the 
    Commission's Enforcement Bureau for possible investigation and 
    administrative action. The Commission may also refer allegations of 
    anticompetitive auction conduct to the Department of Justice for 
    investigation.
