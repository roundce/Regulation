    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is confirming the 
    effective date of April 25, 2016, for the direct final rule that was 
    published in the Federal Register on September 28, 2015. This direct 
    final rule amended the NRC's spent fuel storage regulations by revising 
    the Holtec International (Holtec), HI-STORM (Holtec International 
    Storage Module) Flood/Wind (FW) Multipurpose Canister Storage (MPC) 
    Storage System listing within the ``List of approved spent fuel storage 
    casks'' to add Amendment No. 0, Revision 1, to Certificate of 
    Compliance (CoC) No. 1032. This revision corrects the CoC's expiration 
    date (editorial change), clarifies heat load limits for helium backfill 
    ranges, clarifies the wording for the Limiting Condition for Operation 
    (LCO) on vent blockage, and revises the vacuum drying system heat load.
    
    DATES: Effective date: The effective date of April 25, 2016, for the 
    direct final rule published September 28, 2015 (80 FR 58195), is 
    confirmed.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    
    I. Discussion
    
        On September 28, 2015 (80 FR 58195), the NRC published a direct 
    final rule amending its regulations in Sec.  72.214 of Title 10 of the 
    Code of Federal Regulations by revising the Holtec HI-STORM FW MPC 
    Storage System listing within the ``List of approved spent fuel storage 
    casks'' to add Amendment No. 0, Revision 1, to CoC No. 1032. This 
    revision corrects the CoC's expiration date (editorial change), 
    clarifies heat load limits for helium backfill ranges, clarifies the 
    wording for the LCO on vent blockage, and revises the vacuum drying 
    system heat load.
    
    II. Public Comments on Companion Proposed Rule
    
        In the direct final rule, the NRC stated that if no significant 
    adverse comments were received, the direct final rule would become 
    effective on April 25, 2016. The NRC received public comments from 
    private citizens on the companion proposed rule (80 FR 58222). 
    Electronic copies of these comments can be obtained from the Federal 
    Rulemaking Web site, <http://www.regulations.gov>, by searching for 
    Docket ID NRC-2015-0134. The comments also are available in ADAMS under 
    Accession Nos. ML15296A243, ML15296A241, ML15296A242, ML15299A281, 
    ML15307A612, ML15307A615, ML15307A608, ML15307A609, ML15307A610, and 
    ML15307A611. For the reasons discussed in more detail in Section III, 
    ``Public Comment Analysis,'' of this document, none of the comments 
    received are considered significant adverse comments.
    
    III. Public Comment Analysis
    
        The NRC received comments on the proposed rule, many raising 
    multiple and overlapping issues. As explained in the September 28, 
    2015, direct final rule, the NRC would withdraw the direct final rule 
    only if it received a ``significant adverse comment.'' This is a 
    comment where the commenter explains why the rule would be 
    inappropriate, including challenges to the rule's underlying premise or 
    approach, or would be ineffective or unacceptable without a change.
        In this instance, the NRC determined that none of the comments 
    submitted on the proposed rule are significant adverse comments. The 
    comments were either beyond the scope of this rulemaking or already 
    addressed by the NRC staff's safety evaluation report (SER) (ADAMS 
    Accession No. ML15124A644). The NRC has not made any changes to the 
    direct final rule as a result of the public comments. However, the NRC 
    is taking this opportunity to respond to the comments in an effort to 
    clarify information about the 10 CFR part 72 CoC rulemaking process, 
    and the limited nature of this revision.
        For rulemakings amending or revising a CoC, the scope of the 
    rulemaking is limited to the specific changes requested by the 
    applicant in the request for the amendment or revision. Therefore, 
    comments about the system, or spent fuel storage in general that are 
    not applicable to the changes requested by the applicant, are outside 
    the scope of this rulemaking. Comments about details of the particular 
    system that is the subject of the rulemaking, but that are not being 
    addressed by the specific changes requested, have already been resolved 
    in prior rulemakings. Persons who have questions or concerns about 
    prior rulemakings and the resulting final rules may consider the NRC's 
    petition for rulemaking process under 10 CFR 2.802. Additionally, 
    safety concerns about any NRC-regulated activity may be reported to the 
    NRC in accordance with the guidance posted on the NRC's public Web site 
    at <http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/allegations/safety-concern.html>. This Web site provides information on how to notify the 
    NRC of emergency or non-emergency issues.
        The NRC identified the following issues raised in the comments, and 
    the NRC's responses to these issues follow.
    
    Comment 1
    
        Two comments received from one commenter requested the NRC deny 
    this revision request, expressing concern with the thickness of the 
    canisters. The commenter stated that European systems have a more 
    robust design and that NRC should require the same. The commenter 
    expressed concern that the
    
    [[Page 1117]]
    
    NRC's approval would not be protective of public health and safety.
    
    NRC Response
    
        The comment is out of scope for this revision. It is a general 
    comment recommending that United States' manufacturers utilize some 
    design features used in some European systems. The European systems 
    cited are designed for a different application than dry cask storage 
    systems authorized by 10 CFR 72 Subpart K, ``General License for 
    Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' The HI-STORM FW MPC 
    Storage System was evaluated by the NRC staff to acceptably protect the 
    public health and safety on July 14, 2011 (ADAMS Accession No. 
    ML111950103). The Revision 1 changes were evaluated by the NRC staff to 
    ensure that the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System will continue to protect 
    the public health and safety. These evaluations were performed in 
    accordance with the NRC's existing part 72 regulations. Requests to 
    revise the underlying part 72 requirements are beyond the scope of this 
    revision request.
    
    Comment 2
    
        Two comments, which read ``good'', appeared to indicate support for 
    the rule.
    
    NRC Response
    
        The NRC acknowledges the comments. Because the comments appear to 
    support the rule, the comments are not considered significant adverse 
    comments.
    
    Comment 3
    
        Two commenters expressed concern regarding the vent size, stating 
    that the vents are disproportionately small for such large casks, and 
    poorly located. The commenters also stated that 50% blockage of the 
    vents is unacceptable regardless of temperature, and that, instead, 
    vents should be totally unblocked to be considered operable. The 
    commenters also expressed concern with the protocols for vents that are 
    not operable within 24 hours. The commenters also objected to a 
    perceived inconsistent application of ASME code standards to the CoC.
    
    NRC Response
    
        The HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System design, including the vent size 
    and location, were evaluated by the NRC staff in the initial approval 
    (ADAMS Accession No. ML111950103). The system was ultimately determined 
    to be acceptable because the applicant demonstrated that the system 
    could maintain the spent nuclear fuel below regulatory limits with up 
    to 50% blockage of the inlet and out vents for an indefinite time as 
    long as the spent fuel storage cask heat removal system remains 
    operable. Although this revision includes clarifying changes to the LCO 
    vent blockage language, there are no changes in this revision that 
    impact the underlying analysis evaluated in the initial approval. 
    Additionally, there is no specific information in the comment that 
    would cause the NRC to reevaluate this analysis. Therefore, this 
    comment is not considered a significant adverse comment.
    
    Comment 4
    
        One commenter requested withdrawal of the revision due to concerns 
    that the environmental assessment (EA) that accompanied the rule was 
    inadequate. The commenter expressed concern that, because the EA for 
    this rule tiered off of an EA performed for the 1990 rulemaking that 
    added the general license for storage of spent fuel at power reactor 
    sites, the EA is outdated. The commenter noted that using an outdated 
    EA raises the question of whether the EA is valid in light of the 
    Fukushima disaster that occurred in Japan on March 11, 2011. In 
    addition to withdrawal of the rule, the commenter also requested that a 
    new environmental impact assessment be commissioned, and that all 
    current projects meet at least the minimum standards employed at 
    Fukushima.
    
    NRC Response
    
        This comment is not a significant adverse comment as it fails to 
    present any specific challenge to the EA performed in support of this 
    rule. As noted in the comment, the NRC performed an EA in support of 
    this revision. That EA tiered off of an earlier EA completed to support 
    changes to the part 72 rule that added the general license provisions, 
    but considered environmental impacts specific to this revision. Both of 
    these EAs concluded with a finding of no significant environmental 
    impact. This comment does not provide any specific environmental 
    information relating to the storage of spent fuel at Fukushima that 
    would invalidate the finding of no significant impact in this EA or the 
    earlier EA or that would cause the NRC to reevaluate the environmental 
    impacts associated with this revision to this CoC. Moreover, the staff 
    is unaware of any information that would challenge the findings made in 
    these EAs.
    
    Comment 5
    
        Comments were also received which neither supported nor opposed the 
    rule, but instead, contained numerous questions about this CoC system 
    and other similar CoC systems. Although these comments are not 
    significant adverse comments, and in many instances fall outside the 
    scope of this specific rulemaking, the NRC is taking this opportunity 
    to attempt to address the questions received.
        One commenter asked about temperature values included in the 
    Appendix A Technical Specifications (TS) page 3.1.2-2. The commenter 
    noted that a previous CoC included one temperature value as 137 degrees 
    F, while this CoC TS identifies it as 139 degrees F, but does not 
    reflect it as a revision. The commenter asked which temperature value 
    is correct and the implication of the temperature difference. The 
    commenter also asked how relevant ambient air temperature is to 
    underground systems such as the Holtec HI-STORM UMAX system.
    
    NRC Response
    
        The temperature addressed in the comment is correctly listed as 139 
    degrees F which is applicable to CoC 1032, Amendment No. 0. This 
    temperature was changed to 137 degrees F in CoC 1032, Amendment No. 1. 
    The HI-STORM UMAX is a different system from the HI-STORM FW MPC 
    Storage System and as such has a different thermal design.
    
    Comment 6
    
        Another commenter requested an explanation as to the vendor's 
    statement in the application regarding additional flexibility 
    associated with the limits to the use of vacuum drying to casks at 
    lower heat loads.
    
    NRC Response
    
        In the application for this revision, the applicant contends that 
    lowering this temperature limit provides additional conservatism 
    (margin) that would allow the applicant the flexibility to implement 
    some changes under the 10 CFR 72.48 process rather than through the 
    amendment process. The NRC staff evaluated the lower temperature limit 
    in its preliminary SER (ADAMS Accession No. ML15124A644), and found the 
    lower limit acceptable.
    
    Comment 7
    
        Finally, there were several questions asked about the relationship 
    between this revision and the HI-STORM UMAX system and/or the 
    implications of the changes proposed here to potential uses at the San 
    Onofre Generating Station
    
    [[Page 1118]]
    
    (SONGS). Questions included whether this change addresses the impacts 
    of using the HI-STORM FW system MPC-37 in the HI-STORM UMAX system, and 
    whether it involves ``the proposed San Onofre configuration of only 
    installing \1/2\ underground.'' The commenter questioned what CoC is 
    approved for use in the HI-STORM UMAX system. Another question asked 
    was whether this change allows ``MPC-37 canister thickness increases 
    (such as a change from 0.5'' to 0.625'' proposed for San Onofre) 
    without requiring a license amendment.''
    
    NRC Response
    
        There is no relationship between this revision and the HI-STORM 
    UMAX system. Each system is separately reviewed and certified in 
    accordance with 10 CFR part 72. General licensees may use the certified 
    systems identified in 10 CFR 72.214 subject to meeting certain 
    requirements in 10 CFR part 72. Therefore, the changes in this revision 
    are applicable only to the HI-STORM FW MPC system, CoC No. 1032, and 
    are not applicable to the HI-STORM UMAX system that is intended to be 
    used at SONGS. Nothing in this revision impacts anything associated 
    with the HI-STORM UMAX system; therefore, this revision does not impact 
    the thickness of the canisters in the HI-STORM UMAX system, or the 
    placement of the UMAX system. Additionally, although this rule is a 
    revision to the HI-STORM FW MPC system, nothing in this revision 
    impacts the thickness of the canisters in the HI-STORM FW MPC system.
        For these reasons, the NRC staff has concluded that the comments 
    received on the companion proposed rule for the Holtec HI-STORM FW MPC 
    Storage System listing within the ``List of approved spent fuel storage 
    casks'' to add Amendment No. 0, Revision 1, to CoC No. 1032, are not 
    significant adverse comments as defined in NUREG/BR-0053, Revision 6, 
    ``United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission Regulations Handbook'' 
    (ADAMS Accession No. ML052720461). Therefore, this rule will become 
    effective as scheduled.
