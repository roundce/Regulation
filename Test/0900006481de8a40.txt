    Fisheries of the Exclusive Economic Zone Off Alaska; Inseason 
    Adjustment to the 2016 Gulf of Alaska Pollock and Pacific Cod Total 
    Allowable Catch Amounts
    
    AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.
    
    ACTION: Temporary rule; inseason adjustment; request for comments.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: NMFS is adjusting the 2016 total allowable catch (TAC) amounts 
    for the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) pollock and Pacific cod fisheries. This 
    action is necessary because NMFS has determined these TACs are 
    incorrectly specified, and will ensure the GOA pollock and Pacific cod 
    TACs are the appropriate amounts based on the best available scientific 
    information for pollock and Pacific cod in the GOA. This action is 
    consistent with the goals and objectives of the Fishery Management Plan 
    for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska.
    
    DATES: Effective 1200 hrs, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), January 1, 2016, 
    until the effective date of the final 2016 and 2017 harvest 
    specifications for GOA groundfish, unless otherwise modified or 
    superseded through publication of a notification in the Federal 
    Register.
        Comments must be received at the following address no later than 
    4:30 p.m., A.l.t., January 20, 2016.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the 
    GOA exclusive economic zone according to the Fishery Management Plan 
    for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North 
    Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under authority of the 
    Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Regulations 
    governing fishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP appear at 
    subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679.
        The final 2015 and 2016 harvest specifications for groundfish in 
    the GOA (80 FR 10250, February 25, 2015) set the 2016 pollock TAC at 
    257,178 metric tons (mt) and the 2016 Pacific cod TAC at 75,202 mt in 
    the GOA. In December 2015, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council 
    (Council) recommended a 2016 pollock TAC of 257,872 mt for the GOA, 
    which is more than the 257,178 mt established by the final 2015 and 
    2016 harvest specifications for groundfish in the GOA. The Council also 
    recommended a 2016 Pacific cod TAC of 71,925 mt for the GOA, which is 
    less than the 75,202 mt established by the final 2015 and 2016 harvest 
    specifications for groundfish in the GOA. The Council's recommended 
    2016 TACs, and the area and seasonal apportionments, are based on the 
    Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation report (SAFE), dated November 
    2015, which NMFS has determined is the best available scientific 
    information for these fisheries.
        Steller sea lions occur in the same location as the pollock and 
    Pacific cod fisheries and are listed as endangered under the Endangered 
    Species Act (ESA). Pollock and Pacific cod are a principal prey species 
    for Steller sea lions in the GOA. The seasonal apportionment of pollock 
    and Pacific cod harvest is necessary to ensure the groundfish fisheries 
    are not likely to cause jeopardy of extinction or adverse modification 
    of critical habitat for Steller sea lions. The regulations at Sec.  
    679.20(a)(5)(iv) specify how the pollock TAC will be apportioned. The 
    regulations at Sec.  679.20(a)(6)(ii) and Sec.  679.20(a)(12)(i) 
    specify how the Pacific cod TAC will be apportioned.
        In accordance with Sec.  679.25(a)(1)(iii), (a)(2)(i)(B), and 
    (a)(2)(iv) the Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional 
    Administrator), has determined that, based on the November 2015 SAFE 
    report for this fishery, the current GOA pollock and Pacific cod TACs 
    are incorrectly specified. Consequently, pursuant to Sec.  
    679.25(a)(1)(iii), the Regional Administrator is adjusting the 2016 GOA 
    pollock TAC to 257,872 mt and the 2016 GOA Pacific cod TAC to 71,925 
    mt. Therefore, Table 2 of the final 2015 and 2016 harvest 
    specifications for groundfish in the GOA (80 FR 10250, February 25, 
    2015) is revised consistent with this adjustment.
        Pursuant to Sec.  679.20(a)(5)(iv), Table 4 of the final 2015 and 
    2016 harvest specifications for groundfish in the GOA (80 FR 10250, 
    February 25, 2015) is revised for the 2016 TACs of pollock in the 
    Central and Western Regulatory Area of the GOA.

    Classification
    
        This action responds to the best available information recently 
    obtained from the fishery. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, 
    NOAA (AA), finds good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior 
    notice and opportunity for public comment pursuant to the authority set 
    forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) as such requirement is impracticable and 
    contrary to the public interest. This requirement is impracticable and 
    contrary to the public interest as it would prevent NMFS from 
    responding to the most recent fisheries data in a timely fashion and 
    would allow for harvests that exceed the appropriate allocations for 
    Pacific cod based on the best scientific information available. NMFS 
    was unable to publish a notice providing time for public comment 
    because the most recent, relevant data only became available as of 
    December 28, 2015, and additional time for prior public comment would 
    result in conservation concerns for the ESA-listed Steller sea lions.
        The AA also finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in the 
    effective date of this action under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). This finding is 
    based upon the reasons provided above for waiver of prior notice and 
    opportunity for public comment.
        Under Sec.  679.25(c)(2), interested persons are invited to submit 
    written comments on this action to the above address until January 20, 
    2016.
        This action is required by Sec.  679.20 and Sec.  679.25 and is 
    exempt from review under Executive Order 12866.
