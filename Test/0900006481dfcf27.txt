    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
    
    40 CFR Part 52
    
    [EPA-R06-OAR-2013-0388; FRL-9940-86-Region 6]
    
    
    Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Infrastructure 
    and Interstate Transport State Implementation Plan for the 2010 Sulfur 
    Dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards
    
    AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
    
    ACTION: Final rule.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving 
    elements of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission from the State 
    of Texas for the Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) National Ambient Air 
    Quality Standards (NAAQS). The submittal addresses how the existing SIP 
    provides for implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the 2010 
    SO2 NAAQS (infrastructure SIP or i-SIP). This i-SIP ensures 
    that the State's SIP is adequate to meet the state's responsibilities 
    under the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA).
    
    DATES: This final rule is effective on February 10, 2016.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Throughout this document wherever ``we,'' 
    ``us,'' or ``our'' is used, we mean the EPA.
    
    I. Background
    
        The background for this action is discussed in detail in our 
    October 6, 2015 proposal (80 FR 60314). In that document, we proposed 
    to approve portions of the SIP submittal from the State of Texas 
    adopted on April 23, 2013, and submitted on May 6, 2013. The submittal 
    addresses how the existing SIP provides for implementation, 
    maintenance, and enforcement of the 2010 SO2 NAAQS. This i-
    SIP ensures that the State's SIP is adequate to meet the state's 
    responsibilities under the CAA. We did not receive any comments 
    regarding our proposal.
    
    II. Final Action
    
        EPA is approving portions of the May 6, 2013, infrastructure SIP 
    submission from Texas, which addresses the requirements of CAA sections 
    110(a)(1) and (2) as applicable to the 2010 SO2 NAAQS. 
    Specifically, EPA is approving the following infrastructure elements, 
    or portions thereof: 110(a)(2)(A), (B), (C), (D)(i)(II) (PSD portion), 
    D(ii), (E), (F), (G), (H), (J), (K), (L), and (M). EPA is not taking 
    action on: The portion pertaining to section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I), which 
    concerns interstate pollution transport affecting attainment and 
    maintenance of the NAAQS and the portion pertaining to section 
    110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II) pertaining to visibility protection.
    
    III. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews
    
        Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP 
    submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable 
    Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in 
    reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state choices, 
    provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this 
    action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and 
    does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state 
    law. For that reason, this action:
         Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' subject to 
    review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 
    12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 
    2011);
         Does not impose an information collection burden under the 
    provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);
         Is certified as not having a significant economic impact 
    on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory 
    Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
         Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
    uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded 
    Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);
         Does not have Federalism implications as specified in 
    Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);
         Is not an economically significant regulatory action based 
    on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 
    19885, April 23, 1997);
         Is not a significant regulatory action subject to 
    Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);
         Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the 
    National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
    note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent 
    with the Clean Air Act; and
         Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to 
    address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental 
    effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under 
    Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).
    
    In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation 
    land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated 
    that a tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the 
    rule does not have tribal implications and will not impose substantial 
    direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law as specified 
    by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).
        The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., as added by the 
    Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally 
    provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating 
    the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, 
    to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the 
    United States. EPA will submit a report containing this action and 
    other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of 
    Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior 
    to publication of the rule in the Federal Register. A major rule cannot 
    take effect until 60 days after it is published in the Federal 
    Register. This action is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 
    804(2).
        Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for 
    judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court 
    of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 11, 2016. Filing a 
    petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule 
    does not affect the finality of this action for the purposed of 
    judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for 
    judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness 
    of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in 
    proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
