    SUMMARY: We are superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2004-14-09 for 
    certain Airbus Model A320-211, -212, and -231 airplanes. AD 2004-14-09 
    required repetitive inspections for fatigue cracking of the lower 
    surface panel on the wing center box, and repair if necessary; and 
    modification of the lower surface panel on the wing center box, which 
    constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This new 
    AD retains the requirements of AD 2004-14-09, reduces the compliance 
    times for the repetitive inspections, and requires an additional repair 
    for certain airplanes. This AD was
    
    [[Page 1871]]
    
    prompted by a determination that, based on the average flight duration, 
    the average weight of fuel at landing is higher than that defined for 
    the analysis of the fatigue-related tasks; and that shot peening might 
    have been improperly done on the chromic acid anodizing (CAA) 
    protection, which would adversely affect fatigue crack protection. We 
    are issuing this AD to detect and correct fatigue cracking of the lower 
    surface panel on the wing center box, which could result in reduced 
    structural integrity of the airplane.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    
    Discussion
    
        We issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 CFR 
    part 39 to supersede AD 2004-14-09, Amendment 39-13718 (69 FR 41398, 
    July 9, 2004). AD 2004-14-09 applied to certain Airbus Model A320-211, 
    -212, and -231 airplanes. The NPRM published in the Federal Register on 
    May 8, 2015 (80 FR 26492). The NPRM was prompted by a determination 
    that, based on the average flight duration, the average weight of fuel 
    at landing is higher than that defined for the analysis of the fatigue-
    related tasks; and that shot peening might have been improperly done on 
    the CAA protection, which would adversely affect fatigue crack 
    protection. The NPRM proposed to continue to require repetitive 
    inspections for fatigue cracking of the lower surface panel on the wing 
    center box, and repair if necessary; and modification of the lower 
    surface panel on the wing center box, which constitutes terminating 
    action for the repetitive inspections. The NPRM also proposed to reduce 
    the compliance times for the repetitive inspections, and would require 
    a repair for certain airplanes. We are issuing this AD to detect and 
    correct fatigue cracking of the lower surface panel on the wing center 
    box, which could result in reduced structural integrity of the 
    airplane.
        The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the Technical 
    Agent for the Member States of the European Union, has issued EASA 
    Airworthiness Directive 2014-0065, dated March 14, 2014 (referred to 
    after this as the Mandatory Continuing Airworthiness Information, or 
    ``the MCAI''), to correct an unsafe condition on certain Model A320-
    211, -212, and -231 airplanes. The MCAI states:
    
        During center fuselage certification full scale test, damage was 
    found in the center wing box (CWB) lower surface panel.
        This condition, if not detected and corrected, could affect the 
    structural integrity of the CWB.
        To prevent such damage, Airbus developed mod 22418 which 
    consists in shot-peening of the lower panel in the related area. Mod 
    22418 has been embodied in production from aeroplane [manufacturer 
    serial number] (MSN) 0359. For unmodified in-service aeroplanes, 
    Airbus issued Service Bulletin (SB) A320-57-1082 to introduce 
    repetitive High Frequency Eddy Current (HFEC) inspections on the 
    external face of the center wing box lower panel between Frame (FR) 
    41 and FR42 to detect damage.
        DGAC [Direction G[eacute]n[eacute]rale de l'Aviation Civile] 
    France issued AD 2002-342 [<http://ad.easa.europa.eu/blob/20023420tb_superseded.pdf/AD_F-2002-342_1>] to require these 
    inspections and, depending on findings, applicable corrective 
    action(s). Airbus also issued SB A320-57-1043 as an optional 
    terminating action for the repetitive inspections required by DGAC 
    France AD 2002-342.
        Since that [DGAC] AD was issued, the results of a survey, 
    carried out on the A320 fleet, highlighted some differences between 
    the mission parameters, mainly on the weight of fuel at landing and 
    on the average flight duration, which are higher than those defined 
    for the analysis of the fatigue related tasks.
        These findings have led to an adjustment of the A320 reference 
    fatigue mission. Consequently, the threshold and intervals of these 
    repetitive inspections have been revised and a new threshold figure 
    expressed in flight hours (FH) has been established.
        In addition, it has been identified that, on aeroplanes that 
    have been modified in accordance with Airbus SB A320-57-1043 (Airbus 
    mod 22418) at Revision 05 or an earlier Revision, the shot peening 
    may have been improperly done on the Chromic Acid Anodizing (CAA) 
    protection, which has no fatigue benefit effect. Therefore, the 
    inspections per Airbus SB A320-57-1082 are required again on these 
    aeroplanes.
        Consequently, new shot-peening procedures with proper CAA 
    protection removal instructions have been developed and their 
    embodiment through Airbus SB A320-57-1043 Revision 06 cancels the 
    repetitive inspections per Airbus SB A320-57-1082, as required by 
    DGAC France AD 2002-342.
        For the reasons described above, this new [EASA] AD retains the 
    requirements of DGAC France AD 2002-342, which is superseded, but 
    requires these actions to be accomplished within reduced thresholds 
    and intervals. In addition, the optional terminating action 
    provision (SB A320-57-1043) is amended by including reference to the 
    SB at Revision 06.
    
        The optional terminating action described in Airbus Service 
    Bulletin A320-57-1043, Revision 06, dated December 5, 2013, is 
    accomplishing shot peening in the radius of the milling step between 
    stiffeners 13 and 14 near the fuel pump aperture. You may examine the 
    MCAI in the AD docket on the Internet at <http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail>;D=FAA-2015-1275-0002.
    
    Comments
    
        We gave the public the opportunity to participate in developing 
    this AD. We received no comments on the NPRM (80 FR 26492, May 8, 2015) 
    or on the determination of the cost to the public.
    
    Conclusion
    
        We reviewed the available data and determined that air safety and 
    the public interest require adopting this AD as proposed except for 
    minor editorial changes. We have determined that these minor changes:
         Are consistent with the intent that was proposed in the 
    NPRM (80 FR
    
    [[Page 1872]]
    
    26492, May 8, 2015) for correcting the unsafe condition; and
         Do not add any additional burden upon the public than was 
    already proposed in the NPRM (80 FR 26492, May 8, 2015).
    
    Related Service Information Under 1 CFR Part 51
    
        Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A320-57-1043, Revision 06, dated 
    December 5, 2013. This service information describes procedures for 
    shot peening in the radius of the milling step between stiffeners 13 
    and 14 near the fuel pump aperture.
        Airbus has also issued Service Bulletin A320-57-1082, Revision 04, 
    dated December 5, 2013. This service information describes procedures 
    for inspections for cracking of the lower surface panel on the wing 
    center box.
        This service information is reasonably available because the 
    interested parties have access to it through their normal course of 
    business or by the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.
    
    Costs of Compliance
    
        We estimate that this AD affects 46 airplanes of U.S. registry.
        The actions that were required by AD 2004-14-09, Amendment 39-13718 
    (69 FR 41398, July 9, 2004), and retained in this AD take about 25 
    work-hours per product, at an average labor rate of $85 per work-hour. 
    Based on these figures, the estimated cost of the actions that were 
    required by AD 2004-14-09 is $2,125 per product.
        The new requirements of this AD will add no additional economic 
    burden.
        We have received no definitive data that will enable us to provide 
    cost estimates for the on-condition actions specified in this AD. We 
    have no way of determining the number of aircraft that might need these 
    actions.
    
    Authority for This Rulemaking
    
        Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
    issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
    authority of the FAA Administrator. ``Subtitle VII: Aviation 
    Programs,'' describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's 
    authority.
        We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
    ``Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General 
    requirements.'' Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with 
    promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
    regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator 
    finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within 
    the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition 
    that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this 
    rulemaking action.
    
    Regulatory Findings
    
        We determined that this AD will not have federalism implications 
    under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct 
    effect on the States, on the relationship between the national 
    government and the States, or on the distribution of power and 
    responsibilities among the various levels of government.
        For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
        1. Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 
    12866;
        2. Is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies 
    and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979);
        3. Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska; and
        4. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
    negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
    of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
