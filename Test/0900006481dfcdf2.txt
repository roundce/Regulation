    40 CFR Part 52
    
    [EPA-R07-OAR-2015-0710; FRL-9941-04-Region 7]
    
    
    Approval of Nebraska's Air Quality State Implementation Plan 
    (SIP); Infrastructure SIP Requirements for the 2008 Ozone National 
    Ambient Air Quality Standard in Regards to Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I)--
    Prongs 1 and 2
    
    AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
    
    ACTION: Final rule.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final 
    action to approve elements of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) 
    submission from the State of Nebraska addressing the applicable 
    requirements of Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110 for the 2008 National 
    Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Ozone (O3). CAA 
    section 110 requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP to support 
    implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each new or revised 
    NAAQS promulgated by EPA. These SIPs are commonly referred to as 
    ``infrastructure'' SIPs. The infrastructure requirements are designed 
    to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality 
    management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities 
    under the CAA. Specifically, EPA is approving Nebraska's SIP as it 
    relates to section 110 (a)(2)(D)(i)(I) prongs 1 and 2, for the 2008 
    O3 NAAQS.
    
    DATES: This final rule is effective on February 10, 2016.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Throughout this document, the terms ``we,'' 
    ``us,'' or ``our'' refer to EPA. This section provides additional 
    information by addressing the following:
    
    I. Background
    II. Summary of SIP Revision
    III. Final Action
    IV. Statutory and Executive Order Review
    
    I. Background
    
        On November 16, 2015 (80 FR 70721), EPA published a notice of 
    proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Nebraska. The NPR proposed 
    approval of Nebraska's submission that provides the basic elements 
    specified in section 110(a)(2) of the CAA, or portions thereof, 
    necessary to implement, maintain, and enforce the 2008 O3 
    NAAQS. Specifically, the NPR proposed approval of section 110 
    (a)(2)(D)(i)(I) prongs 1 and 2, for the 2008 O3 NAAQS.
    
    II. Summary of SIP Revision
    
        On February 11, 2013, EPA received a SIP submission from the state 
    of Nebraska that addressed the infrastructure elements specified in 
    section 110(a)(2) for the 2008 O3 NAAQS. On September 15, 
    2015 (80 FR 55266) EPA approved the following infrastructure elements, 
    or portions thereof: 110(a)(2)(A), (B), (C), (D)(i)(II) (prong 3), 
    (D)(ii), (E), (F), (G), (H), (J), (K), (L), and (M) which are necessary 
    to implement, maintain, and enforce the 2008 O3 NAAQS, as a 
    revision to the Nebraska SIP, and disapproved section 
    110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II)- prong 4, as it relates to the protection of 
    visibility. At that time, EPA did not take action on section 
    110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I)- prongs 1 and 2. Specific requirements of section 
    110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I)- prongs 1 and 2 of the CAA and the rationale for 
    EPA's proposed action to approve these specific provisions of the SIP 
    submission, not previously acted on, is explained in the NPR and will 
    not be restated here. The public comment period for the notice of 
    proposed rulemaking (NPR) closed on December 16, 2015. EPA received no 
    comments on the NPR.
    
    III. Final Action
    
        EPA is approving Nebraska's February 11, 2013, submission 
    addressing the requirements of the CAA sections 110(a)(1) and (2) as 
    applicable to the 2008 O3 NAAQS. Specifically, EPA approves 
    section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I)--prongs 1 and 2, which are necessary to 
    implement, maintain, and enforce the 2008 O3 NAAQS, as a 
    revision to the Nebraska SIP. As EPA noted in the NPR, this final 
    action fulfills EPA's commitment to take final action as to Nebraska's 
    SIP submission addressing 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I), as set forth by the court 
    in Sierra Club v. McCarthy, 4:14-cv-05091-YGR (N.D. Cal. May 15, 2015).
    
    IV. Statutory and Executive Order Review
    
        Under the CAA the Administrator is required to approve a SIP 
    submission
    
    [[Page 1123]]
    
    that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable Federal 
    regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP 
    submissions, EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they 
    meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this action merely approves 
    state law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose 
    additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. For that 
    reason, this action:
         Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review 
    by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 12866 (58 
    FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 2011);
         Does not impose an information collection burden under the 
    provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);
         Is certified as not having a significant economic impact 
    on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory 
    Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
         Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
    uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded 
    Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);
         Does not have Federalism implications as specified in 
    Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);
         Is not an economically significant regulatory action based 
    on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 
    19885, April 23, 1997);
         Is not a significant regulatory action subject to 
    Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);
         Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the 
    National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
    note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent 
    with the Clean Air Act; and
         Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to 
    address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental 
    effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under 
    Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).
        The SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or 
    in any other area where EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a 
    tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does 
    not have tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct 
    costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law as specified by 
    Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).
        The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., as added by the 
    Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally 
    provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating 
    the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, 
    to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the 
    United States. EPA will submit a report containing this action and 
    other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of 
    Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior 
    to publication of the rule in the Federal Register. A major rule cannot 
    take effect until 60 days after it is published in the Federal 
    Register. This action is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 
    804(2).
        Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review 
    of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for 
    the appropriate circuit by March 11, 2016. Filing a petition for 
    reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect 
    the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor 
    does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may 
    be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or 
    action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to 
    enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2)).
