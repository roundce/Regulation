    Announcement of Final Regulatory Determinations for Contaminants 
    on the Third Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List
    
    AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
    
    ACTION: Final regulatory determinations.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing 
    final regulatory determinations not to issue national primary drinking 
    water regulations for four of the 116 contaminants listed on the Third 
    Contaminant Candidate List. The Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended in 
    1996, requires the EPA to make regulatory determinations every five 
    years on at least five unregulated contaminants. A regulatory 
    determination is a decision about whether or not to begin the process 
    to propose and promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation 
    for an unregulated contaminant. On October 20, 2014, the agency 
    published its preliminary determinations not to regulate dimethoate, 
    1,3-dinitrobenzene, terbufos, terbufos sulfone and begin the process to 
    regulate strontium. The agency requested public comment on the 
    determinations, process, rationale and supporting technical 
    information. The agency received comments from 14 individuals or 
    organizations on the preliminary regulatory determinations. After 
    careful review and consideration of the public comments, the agency is 
    making a final determination not to regulate dimethoate, 1,3-
    dinitrobenzene, terbufos and terbufos sulfone. The agency, however, is 
    delaying the final regulatory determination on strontium in order to 
    consider additional data and decide whether there is a meaningful 
    opportunity for health risk reduction by regulating strontium in 
    drinking water.
    
    DATES: In accordance with 40 CFR 23.7 for purposes of judicial review, 
    the regulatory determinations in this document are issued as of January 
    4, 2016.

    II. Purpose and Background
    
    A. What is the purpose of this action?
    
        The purpose of this action is to present a summary of the EPA's 
    findings related to the final regulatory determinations for four 
    contaminants listed on the Third Contaminant Candidate List (CCL 3) 
    (USEPA, 2009). The four contaminants include: Dimethoate, 1,3-
    dinitrobenzene, terbufos and terbufos sulfone. Today's action briefly 
    summarizes the statutory requirements for targeting drinking water 
    contaminants for regulatory determination, provides an overview of the 
    contaminants the agency considered for regulation and describes the 
    approach used to make the final regulatory determinations. In addition, 
    today's action summarizes the public comments received on the agency's 
    preliminary determinations and the agency's responses to those 
    comments, including the status of the EPA's evaluation of strontium.
    
    B. What are the statutory requirements for the Contaminant Candidate 
    List (CCL) and regulatory determinations?
    
        The specific statutory requirements for the CCL and regulatory 
    determinations can be found in the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), 
    section 1412(b)(1). The 1996 SDWA Amendments require the EPA to publish 
    the CCL every five years. The CCL is a list of contaminants that are 
    not subject to any proposed or promulgated national primary drinking 
    water regulations (NPDWRs), are known or anticipated to occur in public 
    water systems (PWSs) and may require regulation under SDWA. The 1996 
    SDWA Amendments also direct the agency to determine whether to regulate 
    at least five contaminants from the CCL every five years. SDWA requires 
    the agency to publish a Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) \1\ and 
    promulgate an NPDWR \2\ for a contaminant if the Administrator 
    determines that:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \1\ The MCLG is the ``maximum level of a contaminant in drinking 
    water at which no known or anticipated adverse effect on the health 
    of persons would occur, and which allows an adequate margin of 
    safety. Maximum contaminant level goals are nonenforceable health 
    goals'' (40 CFR 141.2).
        \2\ An NPDWR is a legally enforceable standard that applies to 
    public water systems. An NPDWR sets a legal limit (called a maximum 
    contaminant level or MCL) or specifies a certain treatment technique 
    for public water systems for a specific contaminant or group of 
    contaminants.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        (a) The contaminant may have an adverse effect on the health of 
    persons;
        (b) The contaminant is known to occur or there is a substantial 
    likelihood that the contaminant will occur in public water systems with 
    a frequency and at levels of public health concern; and
        (c) In the sole judgment of the Administrator, regulation of such 
    contaminant presents a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction 
    for persons served by public water systems.
        If the agency determines that all three of these statutory criteria 
    are met, it makes a determination that a national primary drinking 
    water regulation is needed. In that case, the agency has 24 months to 
    publish a proposed MCLG and NPDWR. After the proposal, the agency has 
    18 months to publish a final MCLG and promulgate a final NPDWR (SDWA 
    section 1412(b)(1)(E)).\3\
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \3\ The statute authorizes up to a nine-month extension of this 
    promulgation date.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    C. What contaminants did the EPA consider for regulation?
    
        On October 20, 2014, the EPA published preliminary regulatory 
    determinations for five contaminants on the third Contaminant Candidate 
    List (CCL 3) that had sufficient information to support a regulatory 
    determination (USEPA, 2014c). The five contaminants are 1,3-
    dinitrobenzene, dimethoate, terbufos, terbufos sulfone and strontium. 
    The agency is making final regulatory determinations not to regulate 
    dimethoate, 1,3-dinitrobenzene, terbufos and terbufos sulfone. The 
    agency is not making a final regulatory determination for strontium at 
    this time. The agency's decision to delay a final determination for 
    strontium is based on public comments received and the plan to further 
    evaluate scientific information that became available after publication 
    of the preliminary regulatory determinations. The agency is currently 
    conducting additional scientific analyses to determine if there is a 
    need to develop a national drinking water regulation for strontium. For 
    more information about the comments the agency received on strontium 
    and the analyses that are underway, see section V.A of this notice.
        Information on the five contaminants can be found in the Regulatory 
    Determinations 3 Support Document (USEPA, 2014b). More information is 
    available at the Water Docket (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OW-2012-0155) and 
    also on EPA's Regulatory Determination 3 Web site at <http://www2.epa.gov/ccl/regulatory-determination-3>.
    
    III. What process did the EPA use to make the regulatory 
    determinations?
    
        This section gives a summary of the regulatory determination 
    process the agency followed to identify and evaluate contaminants for 
    the Third Regulatory Determination. For more detailed information on 
    the process and the analyses performed, please refer to the ``Protocol 
    for the Regulatory Determination 3'' document (USEPA, 2014a) and the 
    Federal Register notice for the Preliminary Regulatory Determinations 
    for Contaminants on CCL 3 (USEPA, 2014c).
        The CCL 3 identified 116 contaminants that are currently not 
    subject to any proposed or promulgated national drinking water 
    regulation, are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems, 
    and may require
    
    [[Page 15]]
    
    regulation under SDWA (USEPA, 2009). Since some of the CCL 3 
    contaminants do not have adequate health and/or occurrence data to 
    evaluate against the three statutory criteria (see section II.B of this 
    notice), the agency used a three-phase process to identify which of the 
    contaminants are candidates for regulatory determinations. Priority was 
    given to identifying contaminants known to occur or with substantial 
    likelihood to occur at frequencies and levels of public health concern.
        The three phases of the Third Regulatory Determination process are 
    (1) the Data Availability Phase, (2) the Data Evaluation Phase and (3) 
    the Regulatory Determination Assessment Phase. The overall process is 
    displayed in Exhibit 1.
    BILLING CODE 6560-50-P
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR04JA16.000
    
    BILLING CODE 6560-50-C
        The purpose of the first phase, the Data Availability Phase, is to 
    determine if the agency ``may have'' sufficient data to characterize 
    the potential health effects and known or likely occurrence in drinking 
    water. Although contaminants must have sufficient data to evaluate the 
    statutory criteria in Phase 3, the agency does not want to rule out any 
    contaminants too early in the process; therefore, if sufficient health 
    and occurrence data are likely available, the contaminants are 
    considered in the Data Evaluation Phase, the second phase of the 
    regulatory determination process. From the 116 CCL 3 contaminants, the 
    agency identified 37 contaminants (35 CCL 3 contaminants and two non-
    CCL 3 contaminants \4\) to further evaluate in the second phase.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \4\ The non-CCL 3 contaminants, N-Nitroso-di-n-butylamine (NDBA) 
    and N-Nitrosomethylethylamine (NMEA), were included because they are 
    part of a larger group (nitrosamines) that also includes a number of 
    CCL 3 contaminants.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        During the second phase, the agency further evaluates each 
    contaminant on the short list to identify those that have sufficient 
    data (or are expected to have sufficient data within the timeframe 
    allotted for the second phase) for the EPA to assess the three 
    statutory criteria. As part of the second phase, the agency 
    specifically focuses its efforts on identifying those contaminants or 
    contaminant groups that are occurring or have substantial likelihood to 
    occur at levels and frequencies of public health concern, based on the 
    best available peer reviewed data. If the agency finds that sufficient 
    data are not available or not likely to be available to evaluate the 
    three statutory criteria during the first and second phases, then the 
    contaminant is not considered a candidate for making a regulatory 
    determination.
        If sufficient data are available for a contaminant to characterize 
    the potential health effects and known or likely occurrence in drinking 
    water, the contaminant is evaluated against the three statutory 
    criteria in the Regulatory Determination Assessment Phase, which is the 
    third phase of the process. Of the 37 contaminants that were evaluated 
    under Phase 2, 12 were designated for further evaluation in Phase 3.
    
    [[Page 16]]
    
        Of the 12 contaminants that were evaluated in Phase 3, the agency 
    did not make preliminary regulatory determinations for seven 
    contaminants. The seven contaminants include chlorate and six 
    nitrosamines. Chlorate and the six nitrosamines are disinfection 
    byproducts, and the agency is further evaluating these contaminants as 
    part of the regulatory review of existing Microbial and Disinfection 
    Byproduct regulations, as announced in the Preliminary Regulatory 
    Determination 3 Federal Register notice published on October 20, 2014 
    (USEPA, 2014c).
        After evaluating the five remaining CCL 3 contaminants (dimethoate, 
    1,3-dinitrobenzene, terbufos, terbufos sulfone and strontium) against 
    the three statutory criteria and considering other relevant information 
    (such as level and frequency of occurrence, population exposed and 
    information on sensitive populations and lifestages), the agency made 
    preliminary regulatory determinations to regulate strontium and to not 
    regulate the remaining four contaminants. These preliminary 
    determinations, with their supporting analyses and documentation, were 
    published in the Federal Register on October 20, 2014, for public 
    comment (USEPA, 2014c).
        The EPA received comments from 14 organizations and individuals on 
    the October 20, 2014, Federal Register notice. These 14 organizations 
    and individuals include four environmental organizations, six industry 
    groups, one state association and three anonymous individuals. The 
    agency prepared a Response to Comments document for this action that is 
    available in the Public Docket at [www.regulations.gov](http://www.regulations.gov) under Docket ID 
    No. EPA-HQ-OW-2012-0155. Comments on specific contaminants, and the 
    EPA's responses, are briefly summarized in the sections below.
    
    IV. Summary of the EPA's Findings on the Four Contaminants With Final 
    Regulatory Determinations
    
        After considering the public comments, the EPA is making final 
    regulatory determinations not to regulate dimethoate, 1,3-
    dinitrobenzene, terbufos and terbufos sulfone.
        This notice provides a brief description of the agency findings on 
    these contaminants. Details on the background, health and occurrence 
    information and analyses used to evaluate and make final determinations 
    for these contaminants can be found in the Regulatory Determinations 3 
    Support Document (USEPA, 2015b) and the Federal Register notice for the 
    Preliminary Regulatory Determination 3 (USEPA, 2014c).
        For each contaminant, the agency evaluated the available human and 
    toxicological data, derived a health reference level (HRL),\5\ 
    evaluated the potential and/or likely occurrence and examined the 
    likely exposed population for the contaminant in public water systems. 
    The agency also considered whether information was available on 
    sensitive populations. The agency used the findings from these 
    evaluations to determine whether the three SDWA statutory criteria are 
    satisfied. Table 1 gives a summary of the health and occurrence 
    information for the four contaminants with final determinations under 
    RD 3.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \5\ HRLs are risk derived concentrations against which to 
    evaluate the occurrence data to determine if contaminants may occur 
    at levels of public health concern. They are not the level of a 
    contaminant in drinking water that must not be exceeded to protect 
    any particular population (i.e., an HRL is not an MCL).

    A. Dimethoate
    
    1. Description
        Dimethoate is an organophosphate pesticide, commonly used as an 
    insecticide on field crops (e.g., wheat, alfalfa, corn and cotton), 
    orchard crops, vegetable crops and in forestry. Synonyms for dimethoate 
    include dimethogen, dimeton, dimevur and cygon (HSDB, 2010; USEPA, 
    2007). Dimethoate is considered highly mobile and relatively non-
    persistent in the environment (USEPA, 2007).
    2. Agency Findings
        The agency is making a determination not to regulate dimethoate 
    with an NPDWR. It does not occur at levels and frequencies of public 
    health concern. As a result, the agency finds that an NPDWR does not 
    present a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction.
        The primary data for dimethoate are the 2008-2010 nationally 
    representative drinking water monitoring data, generated through the 
    EPA's Second Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR 2). 
    Dimethoate was not detected in any of the 32,150 UCMR 2 samples 
    collected by 4,140 PWSs (serving ~230 million people) at levels greater 
    than the \1/2\ HRL (7.7 [mu]g/L), the HRL (15.4 [mu]g/L), or the 
    minimum reporting level (MRL) (0.7 [mu]g/L) (USEPA, 2015c). Based on 
    the results of the UCMR 2 samples, the estimated population exposed to 
    dimethoate at levels of public health concern is 0%.
        Other supplementary sources of finished water data from the State 
    of California, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. 
    Geologic Survey (USGS) indicate that the occurrence of dimethoate in 
    PWSs is likely to be low to non-existent. Dimethoate occurrence data 
    for ambient water from the USGS and the Storage and Retrieval (STORET) 
    Data System are consistent with those for finished water. These data 
    sources are discussed in the October 2014 Federal Register notice of 
    the Preliminary Regulatory Determination 3 (USEPA, 2014c).
    
    [[Page 17]]
    
    B. 1,3-Dinitrobenzene
    
    1. Description
        1,3-Dinitrobenzene is a nitro aromatic compound that is used as an 
    industrial chemical and formed as a by-product in the manufacture of 
    munitions, as well as in the production of other substances (HSDB, 
    2009). There are no known natural sources of 1,3-dinitrobenzene. 1,3-
    Dinitrobenzene appears to be moderately persistent in environmental 
    media and moderately mobile in soil and water, although in soils with 
    high clay content it will be less mobile (USEPA, 2015b).
    2. Agency Findings
        The agency is making a determination not to regulate 1,3-
    dinitrobenzene with an NPDWR. It does not occur at levels and 
    frequencies of public health concern. As a result, the agency finds 
    that an NPDWR does not present a meaningful opportunity for health risk 
    reduction.
        The primary data for 1,3-dinitrobenzene are the 2008-2010 
    nationally representative drinking water monitoring data generated 
    through the EPA's UCMR 2 (USEPA, 2015c). UCMR 2 is the only dataset 
    with finished water data for this contaminant. UCMR 2 collected 32,152 
    samples from 4,139 PWSs for 1,3-dinitrobenzene and it was not detected 
    above the MRL (0.8 [mu]g/L), which is only slightly higher than the HRL 
    (0.7 [mu]g/L). Based on the results of the UCMR 2 samples, the 
    estimated population exposed to 1,3-dinitrobenzene at or above the MRL 
    is 0%.
        Findings from the available ambient water data for 1,3-
    dinitrobenzene are consistent with the results in finished water. 
    Ambient water data in STORET included no measured results above 0.33 
    [mu]g/L in 143 samples from 70 sites (USEPA, 2012). It should be noted 
    that some occurrence above the HRL may have gone undetected since 
    reporting levels are not documented. These data sources are discussed 
    in the October 2014 Federal Register notice of the Preliminary 
    Regulatory Determination 3 (USEPA, 2014c).
    
    C. Terbufos and Terbufos Sulfone
    
    1. Description
        Terbufos is a phosphorodithioate pesticide (i.e., an 
    organophosphate) used as an insecticide-nematicide to control a variety 
    of insect pests, primarily used on corn and sugar beets (USEPA, 2006). 
    Terbufos sulfone is a degradate of terbufos. Total toxic residues of 
    terbufos and degradates are highly mobile and persistent in the 
    environment, with terbufos sulfone being more mobile and substantially 
    more persistent than terbufos (USEPA, 2006).
    2. Agency Findings
        The agency is making determinations not to regulate terbufos and 
    terbufos sulfone with NPDWRs. They do not occur at levels and 
    frequencies of public health concern. As a result, the agency finds 
    that an NPDWR does not present a meaningful opportunity for health risk 
    reduction.
        The primary data for terbufos are from the First Unregulated 
    Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR 1) screening survey (2001-2003) 
    (USEPA, 2008). The UCMR 1 screening survey collected 2,301 finished 
    water samples from 295 PWSs for terbufos and it was not detected at 
    levels at or above the MRL (0.5 [mu]g/L), which is slightly higher than 
    the HRL (0.35 [mu]g/L) (USEPA, 2008). Based on the results of the UCMR 
    1 screening survey, the estimated population exposed to terbufos at or 
    above the MRL is 0%.
        The primary data for terbufos sulfone are nationally representative 
    finished water monitoring data generated through the EPA's UCMR 2 
    (2008-2010) (USEPA, 2015c). UCMR 2 collected 32,149 finished water 
    samples from 4,140 PWSs (serving ~230 million people) for terbufos 
    sulfone and it was detected in only one sample, at a concentration of 
    0.42 [mu]g/L. The MRL is 0.4 [mu]g/L, which is slightly higher than the 
    HRL (0.35 [mu]g/L) (USEPA, 2015c). Based on the results of the UCMR 2 
    samples, the estimated population exposed to terbufos sulfone at a 
    level of public health concern (based on the HRL for terbufos) is 
    44,600 (0.02% of the population served by PWSs).
        Finished water data for terbufos and terbufos sulfone from 
    California, Iowa, USDA and USGS are consistent with the UCMR 1 and UCMR 
    2 data. Terbufos and (very limited) terbufos sulfone occurrence data 
    for ambient water from the EPA, STORET and several USGS programs or 
    studies are also consistent with those for finished water. These data 
    sources are discussed in the October 2014 Federal Register notice of 
    the Preliminary Regulatory Determination 3 (USEPA, 2014c).
    
    D. Public Comments on Four Contaminants With Final Regulatory 
    Determinations
    
        The agency received comments in support of the agency's preliminary 
    determinations not to regulate dimethoate, 1,3-dinitrobenzene, terbufos 
    and terbufos sulfone. The agency did not receive any comments to the 
    contrary.
        Agency Response: EPA agrees with the comments and, as previously 
    explained, is making final determinations not to regulate dimethoate, 
    1,3-dinitrobenzene, terbufos and terbufos sulfone.
    
    V. Summary of Public Comments on Strontium and the Agency's Responses
    
    A. Background on Strontium and the EPA's Preliminary Determination
    
        Strontium is a naturally occurring element (atomic number 38) and a 
    member of the alkaline earth metals (ANL, 2007). There are several 
    radioactive strontium isotopes formed by nuclear fission of uranium or 
    plutonium. Since drinking water contamination by radioactive isotopes, 
    including beta particle emitters, is covered under the existing 
    Radionuclides Rule, this section describes the stable \88\Sr isotope.
        In October 2014, the agency made a preliminary determination to 
    regulate strontium with an NPDWR after evaluating the available health, 
    occurrence and other related information against the three SDWA 
    statutory criteria. Specifically, EPA made a preliminary determination 
    that (a) strontium may have an adverse effect on the health of persons, 
    (b) it is known to occur or there is substantial likelihood that 
    strontium will occur in public water systems with a frequency and at 
    levels of public health concern and (c) regulation of strontium with an 
    NPDWR presents a meaningful opportunity to reduce health risks for 
    persons served by PWSs. EPA describes the underlying science in support 
    of these criteria in the Federal Register notice of the Preliminary 
    Regulatory Determination 3 (USEPA, 2014c).
        In the Federal Register notice of the Preliminary Regulatory 
    Determination 3, EPA calculated a non-cancer HRL of 1500 [micro]g/L for 
    strontium using the reference dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day, a default Relative 
    Source Contribution (RSC) of 20% and age-specific exposure factors 
    (i.e., drinking water intake expressed as liters per kg of body weight) 
    for the sensitive population of birth through 18 years to reflect the 
    most active period of bone growth and development. The RSC is the level 
    of exposure believed to result from drinking water when compared to 
    other sources (e.g., food, ambient air). In the Preliminary Regulatory 
    Determination 3 EPA used the default 20% RSC to calculate the HRL. For 
    more detailed information see the October 20, 2014, Federal Register 
    notice of the
    
    [[Page 18]]
    
    Preliminary Regulatory Determination 3 (USEPA, 2014c).
        After consideration of public comments on the preliminary 
    regulatory determination for strontium (see Section V.B.), the agency 
    is delaying the final determination for strontium in order to consider 
    additional scientific data and decide whether there is a meaningful 
    opportunity for health risk reduction by regulating strontium in 
    drinking water.
    
    B. What comments did the EPA receive on strontium?
    
        Some commenters supported the preliminary determination to regulate 
    strontium. These commenters supported a regulation due to the adverse 
    effect on bone growth and/or the potential for elevated levels of 
    strontium in the environment as a result of spills and disposal of 
    waste products related to gas production.
        Many comments called upon the agency to delay the final 
    determination, collect more data and perform additional analyses before 
    making a final determination for strontium. Specifically, the comments 
    were focused on the following areas: The relationship between 
    occurrence and health risk, the RSC of strontium, the costs and 
    benefits of a potential strontium regulation and the feasibility of 
    treating strontium.
        Three commenters questioned whether enough water systems show 
    strontium at levels and frequency of concern that a meaningful 
    reduction in health risk can be achieved through a national regulation. 
    Two of these commenters suggested conducting an epidemiology study that 
    evaluates whether adverse human health effects are occurring and at 
    what drinking water concentrations (and frequency of occurrence) to 
    determine whether there is a meaningful opportunity for health risk 
    reduction of a regulation.
        Two commenters indicated the agency should quantify the RSC or 
    provide stronger justification for using an RSC of 20%. One commenter 
    stated the RSC has a significant impact on the reference dose. One 
    commenter stated that defaults of 20% and 80% have utility in 
    relatively simple circumstances where it is accepted that the drinking 
    water component is either very small or large. The commenter indicated 
    that it is essential to analyze and quantify the RSC when it is 
    intermediate and there are data to perform a meaningful estimate. The 
    commenter asserted that it is essential because the impact on the MCLG 
    and ultimately the MCL and compliance costs can become significant.
        Several commenters indicated concerns with the costs and benefits 
    of a potential strontium regulation. One commenter urged the agency to 
    update the current affordability standard under SDWA before 
    promulgating any new NPDWRs in order to allow rural and small 
    communities to utilize the most economical and safe treatment options. 
    One commenter stated that the agency failed to estimate the social 
    benefits and social costs in its analysis for the strontium 
    determination, specifically the additional energy usage and its 
    externalities. Several commenters compared the cost of a potential 
    strontium regulation to that of the arsenic regulation, based on the 
    percentage and type of systems with strontium occurrence at levels of 
    concern.
        Several commenters supported the agency's commitment to conducting 
    more extensive treatment research prior to promulgating a regulation 
    for strontium. Two commenters indicated that the treatment technology 
    to remove strontium may remove beneficial alkaline earth metals, such 
    as calcium, that partially counter the uptake of strontium.
        Agency Response: The agency is delaying the final determination for 
    strontium in order to consider additional scientific data and decide 
    whether there is a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction by 
    regulating strontium in drinking water.
        Strontium is known to occur in food, ambient air and soil. While 
    data on levels in those media and estimates of intake from those 
    sources were limited when EPA made the preliminary determination to 
    regulate strontium, the EPA is evaluating recent additions to the 
    exposure database to determine if the agency can develop a data-derived 
    RSC rather than using a default 20% RSC in the calculation of the HRL. 
    In the absence of this type of relevant exposure information, the 
    agency supports the use of the default RSC and may ultimately use the 
    default 20% RSC in the final regulatory determination for strontium and 
    for other compounds in the future. The agency selects the default RSCs 
    for regulatory determinations based on the Methodology for Deriving 
    Ambient Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Human Health 
    (USEPA, 2000).
        If the agency makes a final determination to regulate strontium, 
    the EPA will conduct tests on treatment technologies for strontium 
    prior to developing a regulation. The agency understands that strontium 
    may co-occur with beneficial calcium in some drinking water systems and 
    treatment technologies that remove strontium may also remove calcium. 
    The agency is evaluating the effectiveness of treatment technologies 
    under different water conditions, including calcium concentrations. The 
    agency will continue to work with stakeholders in evaluating treatment 
    technologies for strontium.
        At this time, the agency does not plan to initiate any longer term 
    health effect studies, including human epidemiological studies on the 
    relationship of skeletal effects and strontium exposure levels through 
    consumption of drinking water and foods. The agency will continue to 
    evaluate new health studies related to strontium exposure, including 
    any epidemiology studies. It should be noted that while the agency is 
    not precluded from conducting epidemiological studies, the agency is 
    not required to do so to support the decision to regulate a 
    contaminant.
        An evaluation of the costs and benefits of a potential strontium 
    regulation is outside the scope of the regulatory determination 
    process. If the agency decides to regulate strontium, as part of the 
    regulation development process, the agency will conduct a health risk 
    reduction and cost analysis, including an evaluation of the costs and 
    benefits of regulating strontium.
    
    VI. Next Steps
    
        Prior to making a final regulatory determination for strontium, the 
    agency will consider additional data gathered and analyses completed 
    after publication of the preliminary determination (for further 
    information, see discussion in section V.B. of this notice). The agency 
    published the Draft Contaminant Candidate List 4 (CCL 4) on February 4, 
    2015 (USEPA, 2015a) and will issue a Final CCL 4 after consideration of 
    public comments received. The agency will evaluate and consider 
    contaminants on the Final CCL 4 for the Fourth Regulatory 
    Determination.
