    Schedule of Fees for Access to NOAA Environmental Data, 
    Information, and Related Products and Services; Correction
    
    AGENCY: National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service 
    (NESDIS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
    Department of Commerce.
    
    ACTION: Final rule; correcting amendment.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: This action corrects the NESDIS FY 2016 schedule of fees for 
    the sale of its data, information, and related products and services to 
    users. NESDIS is authorized under the United States Code to assess 
    fees, up to fair market value, for access to environmental data, 
    information, and products derived from, collected, and/or archived by 
    NOAA. This action corrects one user fee, titled the Department of 
    Commerce Certification. In the October 22, 2015, final rule, the fee 
    was incorrectly listed as $16.00. The correct user fee should be 
    $116.00.
    
    DATES: Effective January 11, 2016.
    
    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Lewis (301) 713-7073.
    
    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    
    Background
    
        NESDIS operates NOAA's National Center for Environmental 
    Information (NCEI). Through NCEI, NESDIS provides and ensures timely 
    access to global environmental data from satellites and other sources, 
    provides information services, and develops science products. NESDIS 
    maintains some 1,300 databases containing over 2,400 environmental 
    variables at NCEI and seven World Data Centers. These centers respond 
    to over 2,000,000 requests for these data and products annually from 
    over 70 countries. This collection of environmental data and products 
    is growing rapidly, both in size and sophistication, and as a result 
    the associated costs have increased.
        Users have the ability to access the data offline, online and 
    through the NESDIS e-Commerce System (NeS) online store. Our ability to 
    provide data, information, products and services depends on user fees.
    
    New Fee Schedule
    
        In an October 22, 2015, final rule (80 FR 63914), NESDIS 
    established a new schedule of fees for the sale of its data, 
    information, and related products and services to users (``October 2015 
    Fee Schedule Rule''). NESDIS revised the fee schedule that has been in 
    effect since 2013 to ensure that the fees accurately reflect the costs 
    of providing access to the environmental data, information, and related 
    products and services. The new fee schedule lists both the current fee 
    charged for each item and the new fee to be charged to users that took 
    effect beginning November 23, 2015. The schedule applies to the listed 
    services provided by NESDIS on or after this date, except for products 
    and services covered by a subscription agreement in effect as of this 
    date that extends beyond this date. In those cases, the increased fees 
    will apply upon renewal of the subscription agreement or at the 
    earliest amendment date provided by the agreement.
        NESDIS will continue to review the user fees periodically, and will 
    revise such fees as necessary. Any future changes in the user fees and 
    their effective date will be announced through notice in the Federal 
    Register.
    
    Need for Correction
    
        The October 2015 Fee Schedule Rule contains one fee--which appears 
    in a table in Appendix A to Part 950--that was reported incorrectly. 
    The Department of Commerce Certification Fee was listed as $16.00. The 
    last rule had the rate incorrectly listed. The correct fee for this 
    service is $116.00. We now are setting out the entire table with the 
    corrected fee to provide clarity for the public.
    
    Classification
    
        The correction this action makes is minor and merely updates a 
    typographical error within the original final rule. This rule has been 
    determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.
        The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) 
    requiring notice of proposed rulemaking and the opportunity for public 
    comment are inapplicable because this rule falls within the public 
    property exception of subparagraph (a)(2) of section 553, as it relates 
    only to the assessment of fees, as authorized by 15 U.S.C. 1534, that 
    accurately reflect the costs of providing access to publicly available 
    environmental data, information, and related products. Further, no 
    other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an 
    opportunity for
    
    [[Page 1119]]
    
    public comment be given for this rule. Because a notice of proposed 
    rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be 
    given for this rule under 5 U.S.C. 553 or by any other law, the 
    requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) 
    are not applicable. Accordingly, no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is 
    required and none has been prepared.
