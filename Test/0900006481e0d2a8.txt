    Partial Approval and Disapproval of Nevada Air Plan Revisions, 
    Clark County
    
    AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
    
    ACTION: Final rule.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing a 
    partial approval and partial disapproval of revisions to the Clark 
    County portion of the Nevada State Implementation Plan (SIP). The SIP 
    revisions include rescission of four local rules that collectively 
    apply to sources that emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), oxides of 
    sulfur (SOX), and particulate matter (PM). In this final 
    action, the EPA is approving the rescission of two of the rules and 
    disapproving the rescission of the other two rules. Approval of the 
    rescission of the two local rules removes them from the Nevada SIP. The 
    two rules for which the EPA is disapproving rescission remain in the 
    Nevada SIP.
    
    DATES: This rule is effective on February 16, 2016.
    
    ADDRESSES: The EPA has established docket number EPA-R09-OAR-2015-0673

    I. Proposed Action
    
        On November 5, 2015 (80 FR 68486), under section 110(k)(3) of the 
    Clean Air Act (CAA or ``Act''), the EPA proposed a partial approval and 
    partial disapproval of the rescission of four local rules submitted by 
    the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) on November 20, 
    2014 as a revision to the Clark County portion of the Nevada SIP.
        Table 1 lists the rule rescissions that the EPA is approving in 
    today's action, as currently ordered in the Nevada SIP.\1\

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        We proposed approval of the rescission of CCAQR sections 29 and 30, 
    as approved into the SIP, based on our conclusion that these rules were 
    not specifically required under the CAA and that rescission would be 
    consistent with section 110(l) of the CAA, i.e., the rescission of the 
    two rules would not interfere with attainment or maintenance of any of 
    the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). We proposed to 
    disapprove the rescission of CCAQR sections 52 and 60, as approved into 
    the SIP, because rescission would be inconsistent with section 110(l) 
    of the CAA. More specifically, we concluded that rescission of sections 
    52 and 60 would allow for an increase in VOC emissions and thus would 
    not be protective of the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Our conclusion in this 
    regard derives from the following findings:
        1. The rescission of Section 52 would allow an increase in VOC 
    emissions from gasoline dispensing facilities that would not be 
    controlled by other regulations.
        2. The rescission of Section 60 would allow an increase in VOC 
    emissions from the allowance of cutback asphalt use during summer 
    months that would not be controlled by other regulations.
        Our proposed action contains more information on the basis for this 
    rulemaking and on our evaluation of the submittal.
    
    II. Public Comments and EPA Responses
    
        The EPA's proposed action provided a 30-day public comment period. 
    During this period, we received no comments.
    
    III. EPA Action
    
        Under section 110(k)(3) of the Act, the EPA is finalizing a partial 
    approval and partial disapproval of the SIP revision submitted by NDEP 
    on November 20, 2014. More specifically, we are approving the 
    rescission of CCAQR Sections 29 and 30 from the Nevada SIP and we are 
    disapproving the rescission of CCAQR Sections 52 and 60. Rescission of 
    CCAQR Sections 29 and 30 means the removal of the rules from the Nevada 
    SIP. Disapproval of the rescission of CCAQR Sections 52 and 60 means 
    that the rules remain in the Nevada SIP.
        This final partial disapproval does not trigger sanctions or a 
    Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) clock. Sanctions will not be imposed 
    under CAA section 179(b) because the SIP submittal that we are 
    partially disapproving is not a required SIP submittal. The EPA will 
    not promulgate a FIP in this instance under CAA section 110(c)(1) 
    because the partial disapproval of the SIP revision retains existing 
    SIP rules and does not reveal a deficiency in the SIP for the area that 
    a FIP must correct.

    IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews
    
        Additional information about these statutes and Executive Orders 
    can be found at <http://www2.epa.gov/laws-regulations/laws-and-executive-orders>.
    
    A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review and Executive 
    Order 13563: Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review
    
        This action is not a significant regulatory action and was 
    therefore not submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
    for review.
    
    B. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)
    
        This action does not impose an information collection burden under 
    the PRA because this action does not impose additional requirements 
    beyond those imposed by state law.
    
    C. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
    
        I certify that this action will not have a significant economic 
    impact on a substantial number of small entities under the RFA. This 
    action will not impose any requirements on small entities beyond those 
    imposed by state law.
    
    D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA)
    
        This action does not contain any unfunded mandate as described in 
    UMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538, and does not significantly or uniquely affect 
    small governments. This action does not impose additional requirements 
    beyond those imposed by state law. Accordingly, no additional costs to 
    state, local, or tribal governments, or to the private sector, will 
    result from this action.
    
    E. Executive Order 13132: Federalism
    
        This action does not have federalism implications. It will not have 
    substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between 
    the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power 
    and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    
    F. Executive Order 13175: Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments
    
        This action does not have tribal implications, as specified in 
    Executive Order 13175, because the SIP is not approved to apply on any 
    Indian reservation land or in any other area where the EPA or an Indian 
    tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction, and will not 
    impose substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal 
    law. Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this action.
    
    G. Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children From Environmental 
    Health Risks and Safety Risks
    
        The EPA interprets Executive Order 13045 as applying only to those 
    regulatory actions that concern environmental health or safety risks 
    that the EPA has reason to believe may disproportionately affect 
    children, per the definition of ``covered regulatory action'' in 
    section 2-202 of the Executive Order. This action is not subject to 
    Executive Order 13045 because it does not impose additional 
    requirements beyond those imposed by state law.
    
    H. Executive Order 13211: Actions That Significantly Affect Energy 
    Supply, Distribution, or Use
    
        This action is not subject to Executive Order 13211, because it is 
    not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866.
    
    I. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA)
    
        Section 12(d) of the NTTAA directs the EPA to use voluntary 
    consensus standards in its regulatory activities unless to do so would 
    be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. The EPA 
    believes that this action is not subject to the requirements of section 
    12(d) of the NTTAA because application of those requirements would be 
    inconsistent with the CAA.
    
    J. Executive Order 12898: Federal Actions To Address Environmental 
    Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Population
    
        The EPA lacks the discretionary authority to address environmental 
    justice in this rulemaking.
    
    K. Congressional Review Act (CRA)
    
        This action is subject to the CRA, and the EPA will submit a rule 
    report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of 
    the United States. This action is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 
    U.S.C. 804(2).
    
    L. Petitions for Judicial Review
    
        Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for 
    judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court 
    of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 14, 2016. Filing a 
    petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule 
    does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial 
    review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial 
    review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such 
    rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings 
    to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).
