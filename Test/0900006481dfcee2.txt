    [EPA-R04-OAR-2012-0079; FRL-9940-89-Region 4]
    
    
    Air Plan Approval; Alabama: Nonattainment New Source Review
    
    AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
    
    ACTION: Final rule.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final 
    action to approve portions of a revision to the Alabama State 
    Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the Alabama Department of 
    Environmental Management (ADEM) to EPA on May 2, 2011. The SIP revision 
    modifies Alabama's nonattainment new source review (NNSR) regulations 
    in their entirety to be consistent with the federal new source review 
    (NSR) regulations for the implementation of the criteria pollutant 
    national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). EPA is approving 
    portions of the NNSR rule changes in Alabama's May 2, 2011, SIP 
    revision because the Agency has determined that the changes are 
    consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) and federal regulations 
    regarding NNSR permitting.
    
    DATES: This rule will be effective February 10, 2016.
    
    ADDRESSES: EPA has established a docket for this action under Docket 
    Identification No. EPA-R04-OAR-2012-0079. All documents in the docket

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    
    I. Background
    
        EPA is taking final action to approve the portion of Alabama's May 
    2, 2011, SIP revision that makes changes to Alabama's NNSR program, set 
    forth at ADEM Administrative Code, Division 3, Chapter 14, Subchapter 
    .05 (ADEM Rule 335-3-14-.05), which applies to the construction and 
    modification of any major stationary source in or near a nonattainment 
    area (NAA) as required by part D of title I of the CAA. Alabama's NNSR 
    regulations at ADEM Rule 335-3-14-.05 were originally approved into the 
    SIP on November 26, 1979 (see 44 FR 67375), with periodic revisions 
    approved through December 8, 2000 (see 65 FR 76938). Alabama's May 2, 
    2011, SIP revision modifies the State's NNSR regulations in their 
    entirety \1\ with a new version that reflects changes to the federal 
    NNSR regulations at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 51.165,\2\ 
    including provisions promulgated in the following federal rules: (1) 
    ``Requirements for Preparation, Adoption and Submittal of 
    Implementation Plans; Approval and Promulgation of Implementation 
    Plans; Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources,'' Final 
    Rule, 57 FR 32314 (July 21, 1992) (hereafter referred to as the 
    Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) Rule); (2) ``Prevention of 
    Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Nonattainment New Source Review 
    (NSR): Baseline Emissions Determination, Actual-to-Future-Actual 
    Methodology, Plantwide Applicability Limitations, Clean Units, 
    Pollution Control Projects,'' Final Rule, 67 FR 80186 (December 31, 
    2002) (hereafter referred to as the NSR Reform Rule); (3) ``Prevention 
    of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Non-Attainment New Source Review 
    (NSR): Reconsideration,'' Final Rule, 68 FR 63021 (November 7, 2003) 
    (hereafter referred to as the Reconsideration Rule); (4) ``Prevention 
    of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Non-Attainment New Source Review 
    (NSR): Removal of Vacated Elements,'' Final Rule, 72 FR 32526 (June 13, 
    2007) (hereafter referred to as the Vacated Elements Rule); (4) 
    ``Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Nonattainment New Source 
    Review: Reasonable Possibility in Recordkeeping,'' Final Rule, 72 FR 
    72607 (December 21, 2007), (hereafter referred to as the Reasonable 
    Possibility Rule); (5) ``Final Rule To Implement the 8-Hour Ozone 
    National Ambient Air Quality Standard--Phase 2; Final Rule To Implement 
    Certain Aspects of the 1990 Amendments Relating to New Source Review 
    and Prevention of Significant Deterioration as They Apply in Carbon 
    Monoxide, Particulate Matter and Ozone NAAQS; Final Rule for 
    Reformulated Gasoline,'' Final Rule, 70 FR 71612 (November 29, 2005) 
    (hereafter referred to as the Phase 2 Rule); (6) ``Implementation of 
    the New Source Review (NSR) Program for Particulate Matter Less Than 
    2.5 Micrometers (PM2.5),'' Final Rule, 73 FR 28321 (May 16, 
    2008) (hereafter referred to as the NSR PM2.5 Rule); (7) 
    ``Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) for Particulate Matter 
    Less Than 2.5 Micrometers (PM2.5)--Increments, Significant 
    Impact Levels (SILs) and Significant Monitoring Concentration (SMC),'' 
    Final Rule, 75 FR 64864 (October 20, 2010) (hereafter referred to as 
    the PM2.5 PSD Increments-SILs-SMC Rule \3\); and (8) 
    ``Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Nonattainment New 
    Source Review (NSR): Reconsideration of Inclusion of Fugitive 
    Emissions; Interim Rule; Stay and Revisions'', Interim Rule, 76 FR 
    17548 (March 30, 2011) (hereafter referred to as the Fugitive Emissions 
    Interim Rule).
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \1\ Some portions of the 2011 version of the regulations now 
    being approved were previously approved by EPA. These portions 
    remain the same in substance but may have undergone administrative 
    updates and renumbering in the 2011 version.
        \2\ EPA's regulations governing the implementation of NSR 
    permitting programs are contained in 40 CFR 51.160-51.166; 52.21, 
    52.24; and part 51, appendix S. The CAA NSR program is composed of 
    three separate programs: PSD, NNSR, and Minor NSR. PSD is 
    established in part C of title I of the CAA and applies in areas 
    that meet the NAAQS--``attainment areas''--as well as areas where 
    there is insufficient information to determine if the area meets the 
    NAAQS--``unclassifiable areas.'' The NNSR program is established in 
    part D of title I of the CAA and applies in areas that are not in 
    attainment of the NAAQS--``nonattainment areas.'' The Minor NSR 
    program addresses construction or modification activities that do 
    not qualify as ``major'' and applies regardless of the designation 
    of the area in which a source is located. Together, these programs 
    are referred to as the NSR programs.
        \3\ The D.C. Circuit vacated the portions of the 
    PM2.5 PSD Increment-SILs-SMC Rule addressing the SMC and 
    SILs (and remanded the SILs portion to EPA for further 
    consideration) for PSD, but left the PM2.5 SILs in place 
    for the NSR program in the table in Sec.  51.165(b)(2). See Sierra 
    Club v. EPA, 705 F.3d 458 (D.C. Cir. 2013).
    
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    [[Page 1125]]
    
        EPA is not, however, approving into the Alabama SIP the portion of 
    ADEM Rule 335-3-14-.05(1)(k) stating ``excluding ethanol production 
    facilities that produce ethanol by natural fermentation,'' which 
    Alabama promulgated pursuant to the federal rule entitled ``Prevention 
    of Significant Deterioration, Nonattainment New Source Review, and 
    Title V: Treatment of Certain Ethanol Production Facilities Under the 
    `Major Emitting Facility' Definition,'' Final Rule, 72 FR 24060 (May 1, 
    2007) (or the Ethanol Rule).\4\ EPA is also not acting on the provision 
    at Rule 335-3-14-.05(2)(c)3 that excludes fugitive emissions from the 
    determinion of creditable emission increases and decreases.\5\ Finally, 
    EPA is not acting on changes to ADEM's rules regarding the 
    PM2.5 significant impact levels (SILs) for PSD at Rule 335-
    3-14-.04(8)(h)1., the NNSR interpollutant offset ratios at ADEM Rule 
    335-3-14-.05(3)(g)1-4 and the sentence including those ratios which 
    states ``Interpollutant offsets shall be determined based upon the 
    following ratios,'' or the ``actual-to-potential'' NNSR applicability 
    test at ADEM Rule 335-3-14-.05(1)(h), all of which ADEM withdrew from 
    EPA's consideration subsequent to the May 2, 2011 submittal.\6\
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \4\ Alabama's changes to its NNSR regulations (at 335-3-
    14-.05(1)(k)) exclude ``chemical process plants'' that produce 
    ethanol through a natural fermentation process from the NSR major 
    source permitting requirement as promulgated in the Ethanol Rule (as 
    amended at 40 CFR 51.165). See 72 FR 24060 (May 1, 2007). However, 
    due to a petition by Natural Resources Defense Council to reconsider 
    the rule, EPA is not proposing to take action to approve this 
    provision into the Alabama SIP at this time. Pending final 
    resolution, EPA will make a final determination on action regarding 
    this portion of Alabama's SIP revision.
        \5\ The provision in question was originally approved into the 
    CFR in the December 19, 2008 (73 FR 77882) final rule concerning the 
    treatment of fugitive emissions for the purposes of NSR 
    applicability. On April 24, 2009, EPA agreed to reconsider the 
    approach to handling fugitive emissions and granted a 3-month 
    administrative stay of the December 19, 2008 rule. After several 
    stays, this provision was stayed indefinitely in the March 30, 2011 
    (76 FR 17548) Fugitive Emissions Interim Rule, pending a final 
    reconsideration from EPA. For more information on fugitive emissions 
    in NSR, see the September 1, 2015 proposed rulemaking (80 FR 52701) 
    or refer to the Docket for this rulemaking.
        \6\ For more information on the withdrawal of these elements 
    from the initial May 2, 2011, submittal, see the September 1, 2015, 
    proposed rulemaking (80 FR 52701) or refer to the Docket for this 
    rulemaking.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        On September 1, 2015, EPA published a proposed rulemaking to 
    approve the aforementioned changes to the Alabama NNSR program at ADEM 
    Rule 335-3-14-.05. See 80 FR 52701. Comments on the proposed rulemaking 
    were due on or before October 1, 2015. No comments, adverse or 
    otherwise, were received on EPA's September 1, 2015, proposed 
    rulemaking. Pursuant to section 110 of the CAA, EPA is now taking final 
    action to approve the changes to Alabama's NNSR program as provided in 
    the September 1, 2015, proposed rulemaking. The proposed rulemaking 
    contains more detailed information regarding Alabama's SIP revision 
    being approved today, and the rationale for this final action. More 
    detailed information on the NNSR program can be found in the September 
    1, 2015, proposed rulemaking as well as the aforementioned final 
    rulemakings.
    
    II. This Action
    
        Alabama currently has a SIP-approved NSR program for new and 
    modified stationary sources found in ADEM regulations at Chapter 335-3-
    14. ADEM's NNSR preconstruction regulations are found at Chapter 335-3-
    14-.05 and apply to major stationary sources or modifications 
    constructed in or impacting upon a nonattainment area as required under 
    part D of title I of the CAA with respect to the NAAQS. The changes to 
    Chapter 335-3-14-.05 that EPA is now approving into the SIP were 
    provided to update the existing provisions to be consistent with the 
    current federal NNSR rules, including the WEPCO Rule, 2002 NSR Reform 
    Rule (and associated Reconsideration Rule and Vacated Elements Rule), 
    Phase 2 Rule, NSR PM2.5 Rule, PM2.5 PSD-
    Increment-SILs-SMC Rule, and Fugitive Emissions Interim Rule. These 
    changes to ADEM's regulations became state effective on May 23, 2011.
    
    III. Incorporation by Reference
    
        In this rule, EPA is finalizing regulatory text that includes 
    incorporation by reference. In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 
    51.5, EPA is finalizing the incorporation by reference of portions of 
    ADEM Regulation Chapter 335-3-14-.05 entitled ``Air Permits Authorizing 
    Construction in or Near Non-Attainment Areas,'' effective May 23, 2011, 
    with revisions and additions to applicability, definitions, permitting 
    requirements, offset rules, area classifications, air quality models, 
    control technology review, air quality monitoring, source information, 
    source obligation, innovative control technology, and actuals plantwide 
    applicability limits, and with administrative changes throughout. EPA 
    has made, and will continue to make, these documents generally 
    available electronically through [www.regulations.gov](http://www.regulations.gov) and/or in hard 
    copy at the EPA Region 4 office (see the ADDRESSES section of this 
    preamble for more information).
    
    IV. Final Action
    
        EPA is taking final action to approve the portions of Alabama's May 
    2, 2011, submission that make changes to Alabama's SIP-approved NNSR 
    regulations set forth at ADEM Rule 335-3-14-.05, with the exceptions 
    noted above. ADEM submitted the proposed changes to its NNSR SIP to be 
    consistent with amendments to the federal regulations made by the WEPCO 
    Rule, the 2002 NSR Reform Rule (and associated Reconsideration Rule and 
    Vacated Elements Rule), Phase 2 Rule, NSR PM2.5 Rule, 
    PM2.5 PSD Increment-SILs-SMC Rule, and the Fugitive 
    Emissions Interim Rule. The Agency is approving these changes to the 
    Alabama SIP because they are consistent with section 110 of the CAA and 
    EPA regulations.
    
    V. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews
    
        Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP 
    submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable 
    Federal regulations. See 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in 
    reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state choices, 
    provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this 
    action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and 
    does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state 
    law. For that reason, this action:
         Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' subject to 
    review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 
    12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 
    2011);
         does not impose an information collection burden under the 
    provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);
         is certified as not having a significant economic impact 
    on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory 
    Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
         does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
    uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded 
    Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);
    
    [[Page 1126]]
    
         does not have Federalism implications as specified in 
    Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);
         is not an economically significant regulatory action based 
    on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 
    19885, April 23, 1997);
         is not a significant regulatory action subject to 
    Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);
         is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the 
    National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
    note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent 
    with the CAA; and
         does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to 
    address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental 
    effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under 
    Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).
        The SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or 
    in any other area where EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a 
    tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does 
    not have tribal implications as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 
    FR 67249, November 9, 2000), nor will it impose substantial direct 
    costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law.
        The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., as added by the 
    Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally 
    provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating 
    the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, 
    to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the 
    United States. EPA will submit a report containing this action and 
    other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of 
    Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior 
    to publication of the rule in the Federal Register. A major rule cannot 
    take effect until 60 days after it is published in the Federal 
    Register. This action is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 
    804(2).
        Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review 
    of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for 
    the appropriate circuit by March 11, 2016. Filing a petition for 
    reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect 
    the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor 
    does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may 
    be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or 
    action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to 
    enforce its requirements. See section 307(b)(2).
