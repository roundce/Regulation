    operating schedule that governs the Highway 160 drawbridge across Three 
    Mile Slough, mile 0.1, at Rio Vista, CA. The deviation is necessary to 
    allow the bridge owner to make necessary bridge maintenance repairs. 
    This deviation allows the bridge to be secured in the closed-to-
    navigation position during the deviation period.

    to 11:59 p.m. on April 10, 2016.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The California Department of Transportation 
    has requested a temporary change to the operation of the Highway 160 
    drawbridge, mile 0.1, over Three Mile Slough, at Rio Vista, CA. The 
    drawbridge navigation span provides 12 feet vertical clearance above 
    Mean High Water in the closed-to-navigation position. In accordance 
    with 33 CFR 117.5, the draw opens on signal. Navigation on the waterway 
    is commercial, search and rescue, law enforcement, and recreational.
        The drawbridge will be secured in the closed-to-navigation position 
    from 12:01 a.m. on January 5, 2016 to 11:59 p.m. on April 10, 2016, to 
    allow the bridge owner to perform sand blasting and painting 
    rehabilitation. A containment scaffolding system will be installed 
    below low steel of the entire length of the bridge structure, reducing 
    vertical clearance for navigation by not more than 4 feet, and will be 
    lighted at night with red lights. This temporary deviation has been 
    coordinated with the waterway users. No objections to the proposed 
    temporary deviation were raised.
        Vessels able to pass through the bridge in the closed position may 
    do so at any time. The bridge will not be able to open for emergencies. 
    The confluence of the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers can be used as 
    an alternate route for vessels unable to pass through the bridge in the 
    closed position. The Coast Guard will also inform waterway users 
    through our Local and Broadcast Notices to Mariners of the change in 
    operating schedule for the bridge so that vessel operators can arrange 
    their transits to minimize any impact caused by the temporary 
    deviation.
        In accordance with 33 CFR 117.35(e), the drawbridge must return to 
    its regular operating schedule immediately at the end of the effective 
    period of this temporary deviation. This deviation from the operating 
    regulations is authorized under 33 CFR 117.35.
    
        Dated: December 15, 2015.
    D.H. Sulouff,
    District Bridge Chief, Eleventh Coast Guard District.
