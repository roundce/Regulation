    Safety Zone; Intracoastal Waterway; Lake Charles, LA
    
    AGENCY: Coast Guard, DHS.
    
    ACTION: Temporary final rule.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for 
    all waters of the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) extending 100-yards east 
    and west of ICW Mile Marker 244.5 located at position 30[deg]03'38'' N. 
    093[deg]22'19'' W. (NAD 83) in Lake Charles, Louisiana. This safety 
    zone is necessary to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine 
    environment from hazards created by high power electrical line 
    installation operations via helicopter over the Intracoastal Waterway. 
    Entry of vessels or persons into this safety zone is prohibited unless 
    specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Port Arthur.
    
    DATES: This rule is effective from 7 a.m. on January 4, 2016 through 6 
    p.m. on January 14, 2016. This rule will be enforced when personnel and 
    equipment are on scene and conducting working on electrical lines.

    II. Background Information and Regulatory History
    
        The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary rule without prior notice 
    and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of 
    the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). This 
    provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and 
    opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those 
    procedures are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public 
    interest.'' Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good 
    cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) 
    with respect to this rule because immediate action is needed to protect 
    vessels and mariners from the hazards associated with electrical line 
    installation operations over the Intracoastal Waterway. The Coast Guard 
    was not notified of the impending electrical line installation by 
    ENTERGY until approximately three weeks prior to the date of the 
    planned installation. After review of the details, the Coast Guard 
    determined action is needed to protect vessels and mariners from the 
    potential hazards created by the electrical line installation. It is 
    impracticable to publish an NPRM because we must establish this safety 
    zone by January 4, 2016.
        We are issuing this rule, and under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast 
    Guard finds that good cause exists for making it effective less than 30 
    days after publication in the Federal Register. The Coast Guard 
    received less than 30-day's notice that ENTERGY set the electrical line 
    installation date for January 4, 2016 through January 14, 2016. 
    Delaying the effective date of this rule would be contrary to public 
    interest because immediate action is needed to respond to the potential 
    safety hazards associated with electrical line installation operations 
    over the Intracoastal Waterway. The Coast Guard will notify the public 
    and maritime community that the safety zone will be in effect and of 
    its enforcement periods via broadcast notices to mariners (BNM) and 
    will be published in the Local Notice to Mariners (LNM).
    
    III. Legal Authority and Need for Rule
    
        The Coast Guard is issuing this rule under authority in 33 U.S.C. 
    1231. The Captain of the Port, Port Arthur (COTP) has determined that 
    the hazards associated with high power line installations beginning 
    January 4, 2016
    
    [[Page 12]]
    
    through January 14, 2016 will be a safety concern for anyone within a 
    100-yard radius of helicopter cable installation operations. This rule 
    is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment in 
    the navigable waters within the safety zone while high power cable 
    installation operations occur.
    
    IV. Discussion of the Rule
    
        This rule establishes a safety zone from 7 a.m. on January 4, 2016 
    through 6 p.m. on January 14, 2016. The safety zone will cover all 
    navigable waters, shoreline to shoreline, extending 100-yards to either 
    side of helicopter high power cable installation operations and 
    machinery being used by personnel to install the high power cables. The 
    duration of the zone is intended to protect personnel, vessels, and the 
    marine environment in these navigable waters while the electrical lines 
    are being installed. No vessel or person will be permitted to enter the 
    safety zone without obtaining permission from the COTP or a designated 
    representative.
    
    V. Regulatory Analyses
    
        We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and 
    executive orders (E.O.s) related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our 
    analyses based on a number of these statutes and E.O.s, and we discuss 
    First Amendment rights of protestors.
    
    A. Regulatory Planning and Review
    
        E.O.s 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the costs and 
    benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is 
    necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits. 
    E.O. 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and 
    benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting 
    flexibility. This rule has not been designated a ``significant 
    regulatory action,'' under E.O. 12866. Accordingly, it has not been 
    reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
        This regulatory action determination is based on the size, 
    location, and duration of the safety zone. This rule will only be 
    enforced for short periods when the channel is obstructed or cable 
    installation operations over Intracoastal Waterway pose hazards to 
    mariners. Moreover, the Coast Guard will issue Broadcast Notice to 
    Mariners via VHF-FM marine channel 16 about the zone and the rule 
    allows vessel to seek permission to enter the zone.
    
    B. Impact on Small Entities
    
        The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, as 
    amended, requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of 
    regulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term ``small 
    entities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations 
    that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their 
    fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 
    50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule 
    will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
    small entities.
        While some owners or operators of vessels intending to transit the 
    safety zone may be small entities, for the reasons stated in section 
    V.A above, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on 
    vessel owners or operators.
        Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
    Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we want to assist small 
    entities in understanding this rule. If the rule would affect your 
    small business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have 
    questions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please 
    contact the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 
    section.
        Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal 
    employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal 
    regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory 
    Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory 
    Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and 
    rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to 
    comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR 
    (1-888-734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small 
    entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or 
    action of the Coast Guard.
    
    C. Collection of Information
    
        This rule will not call for a new collection of information under 
    the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).
    
    D. Federalism and Indian Tribal Governments
    
        A rule has implications for federalism under E.O. 13132, 
    Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on the States, on the 
    relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
    distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of 
    government. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have 
    determined that it is consistent with the fundamental federalism 
    principles and preemption requirements described in E.O. 13132.
        Also, this rule does not have tribal implications under E.O. 13175, 
    Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because 
    it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian 
    tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian 
    tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between 
    the Federal Government and Indian tribes. If you believe this rule has 
    implications for federalism or Indian tribes, please contact the person 
    listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section above.
    
    E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
    
        The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) 
    requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary 
    regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may 
    result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in 
    the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for 
    inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in 
    such expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in 
    this preamble.
    
    F. Environment
    
        We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security 
    Management Directive 023-01 and Commandant Instruction M16475.lD, which 
    guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental 
    Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have determined that 
    this action is one of a category of actions that do not individually or 
    cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This 
    rule involves a safety zone lasting less than 10 days that will 
    prohibit entry within 100-yards of vessels and machinery being used for 
    high power cable installation. It is categorically excluded from 
    further review under paragraph 34(g) of Figure 2-1 of the Commandant 
    Instruction. An environmental analysis checklist supporting this 
    determination and a Categorical Exclusion Determination are available 
    in the docket where indicated under ADDRESSES. We seek any comments or 
    information that may lead to the discovery of a significant 
    environmental impact from this rule.
    
    G. Protest Activities
    
        The Coast Guard respects the First Amendment rights of protesters. 
    Protesters are asked to contact the
    
    [[Page 13]]
    
    person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section to 
    coordinate protest activities so that your message can be received 
    without jeopardizing the safety or security of people, places or 
    vessels.
