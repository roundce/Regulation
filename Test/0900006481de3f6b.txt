    SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) is 
    adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and 
    Retrieval System (EDGAR) Filer Manual and related rules to reflect 
    updates to the EDGAR system. The updates are being made to add the 
    submission form types X-17A-5 and X-17A-5/A for broker-dealer annual 
    reports in electronic format; add the new submission form types C, C-W, 
    C-U, C-U-W, C/A, C/A-W, C-AR, C-AR-W, C-AR/A, C-AR/A-W, C-TR and C-TR-W 
    pursuant to Regulation Crowdfunding; add the new submission form types 
    N-MFP1 and N-MFP1/A for money market mutual funds; disseminate raw and 
    rendered eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) submissions; and 
    update Item 1 of the Regulation A submission form types 1-A, 1-A/A, 1-A 
    POS, DOA, and DOS/A to accept negative values in the ``Total Assets,'' 
    ``Total Stockholders' Equity,'' and ``Total Liabilities and Equity'' 
    fields. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded to support this 
    functionality on December 14, 2015. On January 25, 2016, EDGAR will be 
    updated to add new ``Funding Portal'' applicant type for filers to 
    select when completing the process to apply for EDGAR access (New) on 
    the EDGAR Filer Management Web site; and add the new submission form 
    types CFPORTAL, CFPORTAL/A and CFPORTAL-W pursuant to Regulation 
    Crowdfunding.
    
    DATES: Effective January 4, 2016. The incorporation by reference of the 
    EDGAR Filer Manual is approved by the Director of the Federal Register 
    as of January 4, 2016.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We are adopting an updated EDGAR Filer 
    Manual, Volume I and Volume II. The Filer Manual describes the 
    technical formatting requirements for the preparation and submission of 
    electronic filings through the EDGAR system.\1\ It also describes the 
    requirements for filing using EDGARLink Online and the Online Forms/XML 
    Web site.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \1\ We originally adopted the Filer Manual on April 1, 1993, 
    with an effective date of April 26, 1993. Release No. 33-6986 (April 
    1, 1993) [58 FR 18638]. We implemented the most recent update to the 
    Filer Manual on September 15, 2015. See Release No. 34-75918 
    (October 2, 2015) [80 FR 59578].
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        The revisions to the Filer Manual reflect changes within Volume I 
    entitled EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume I: ``General Information,'' Version 
    24 (December 2015), and Volume II entitled EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume 
    II: ``EDGAR Filing,'' Version 35 (December 2015). The updated manual 
    will be incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations.
        The Filer Manual contains all the technical specifications for 
    filers to submit filings using the EDGAR system. Filers must comply 
    with the applicable provisions of the Filer Manual in order
    
    [[Page 4]]
    
    to assure the timely acceptance and processing of filings made in 
    electronic format.\2\ Filers may consult the Filer Manual in 
    conjunction with our rules governing mandated electronic filing when 
    preparing documents for electronic submission.\3\
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \2\ See Rule 301 of Regulation S-T (17 CFR 232.301).
        \3\ See Release No. 34-75918 in which we implemented EDGAR 
    Release 15.3. For additional history of Filer Manual rules, please 
    see the cites therein.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        The EDGAR system will be upgraded to Release 15.4 on December 14, 
    2015 and will introduce the following changes:
        Broker-dealers will now be able to submit Form X-17A-5 Part III in 
    electronic format using the following submission form types:
    
     X-17A-5--Annual Reports
     X-17A-5/A--Amendment to Annual Reports
    
        These submission form types can be accessed by clicking the ``File 
    X-17A-5 Part III'' link on the EDGAR Filing Web site. Additionally, 
    filers may construct XML submissions for X-17A-5 and X-17A-5/A by 
    following the ``EDGAR Form X-17A-5 XML Technical Specification'' 
    document located on the SEC's Public Web site (<http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar.shtml>). Form X-17A-5 Part III will continue to be accepted in 
    paper format.
        Submission form types X-17A-5 and X-17A-5/A will include the 
    ``Request Confidentiality'' check box to allow applicants to request 
    confidential treatment for each attached document that is not required 
    to be made public. EDGAR will not disseminate any attached documents 
    that are designated as confidential.
        Pursuant to Regulation Crowdfunding, EDGAR will be updated to 
    include the following new submission form types:
    
     C: Offering Statement
     C-W: Offering Statement Withdrawal
     C-U: Progress Update
     C-U-W: Progress Update Withdrawal
     C/A: Amendment to Offering Statement
     C/A-W: Amendment to Offering Statement Withdrawal
     C-AR: Annual Report
     C-AR-W: Annual Report Withdrawal
     C-AR/A: Amendment to Annual Report
     C-AR/A-W: Amendment to Annual Report Withdrawal
     C-TR: Termination of Reporting
     C-TR-W: Termination of Reporting Withdrawal
    
        Issuers can access these submission form types from the 
    ``Regulation Crowdfunding'' link on the EDGAR Filing Web site. 
    Additionally, issuers may construct XML submissions for these 
    submission form types by following the ``EDGAR Form C XML Technical 
    Specification'' document located on the SEC's Public Web site (<http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar.shtml>). See Release No. 33-9974 for the 
    effective date.
        In connection with amendments to the rules governing money market 
    mutual funds (or ``money market funds'') under the Investment Company 
    Act of 1940 the following changes will be made:
         EDGAR will be updated to include two new submission 
    types--N-MFP1 and N-MFP1/A--to incorporate the amendments to Form N-MFP 
    adopted by the Commission on July 23, 2014.\4\
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \4\ See Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form PF, Release 
    33-9616 (July 23, 2014).
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        These two new submission types will be accepted from the EDGAR 
    Filing Web site via filer-constructed XML submissions, as described in 
    the Form N-MFP1 XML Technical Specification available on the SEC's 
    Public Web site (<http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar.shtml>). EDGAR will only 
    accept TEST submissions for submission form types N-MFP1 and N-MFP1/A 
    until April 14, 2016. Beginning on April 14, 2016, submission form 
    types N-MFP1 and N-MFP1/A will be accepted as LIVE submissions. After 
    that date, filers will be prevented from submitting existing submission 
    form type N-MFP. In addition, EDGAR will be updated to automatically 
    disseminate money market fund information upon acceptance of the N-MFP1 
    and N-MFP1/A submissions.\5\
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \5\ See Release 33-9616 for additional information.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        EDGAR will be updated to disseminate raw and rendered XBRL 
    documents. The rendered eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) 
    documents will be displayed as human-readable documents.
        Finally, EDGAR will be updated to accept negative values in the 
    ``Total Assets,'' ``Total Stockholders' Equity,'' and ``Total 
    Liabilities and Equity'' fields in Item 1 of the submission form types 
    1-A, 1-A/A, 1-A POS, DOS and DOS/A.
        On January 25, 2016, EDGAR Release 16.0.1 will introduce the 
    following changes:
         Filers will now be able to select the new ``Funding 
    Portal'' Applicant Type when completing the process to apply for EDGAR 
    access (New) on the EDGAR Filer Management Web site.
         Pursuant to Regulation Crowdfunding, Funding Portals will 
    be able to register with the Commission, amend their registration and 
    withdraw their registration, using the following new submission form 
    types:
        [cir] CFPORTAL--Form Funding Portal: Initial application of funding 
    portal.
        [cir] CFPORTAL/A--Form Funding Portal/A: Amendment to registration, 
    including a successor registration.
        [cir] CFPORTAL-W--Form Funding Portal-W: Withdrawal of the funding 
    portal's registration.
        These submission form types can be accessed by clicking the 
    ``Regulation Crowdfunding'' link on the EDGAR Filing Web site. 
    Additionally, filers may construct XML submissions for CFPORTAL, 
    CFPORTAL/A, and CFPORTAL-W by following the ``EDGAR Form CFPORTAL XML 
    Technical Specification'' document located on the SEC's Public Web site 
    (<http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar.shtml>).\6\
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \6\ See Crowdfunding, Release 33-9974 (80 FR 71387, November 16, 
    2015) for the effective dates for Regulation Crowdfunding.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        Along with the adoption of the Filer Manual, we are amending Rule 
    301 of Regulation S-T to provide for the incorporation by reference 
    into the Code of Federal Regulations of today's revisions. This 
    incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal 
    Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
        The updated EDGAR Filer Manual will be available for Web site 
    viewing and printing; the address for the Filer Manual is <http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar.shtml>. You may also obtain paper copies of the 
    EDGAR Filer Manual from the following address: Public Reference Room, 
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE., Washington, 
    DC 20549, on official business days between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 
    3:00 p.m.
        Since the Filer Manual and the corresponding rule changes relate 
    solely to agency procedures or practice, publication for notice and 
    comment is not required under the Administrative Procedure Act 
    (APA).\7\ It follows that the requirements of the Regulatory 
    Flexibility Act \8\ do not apply.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \7\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b).
        \8\ 5 U.S.C. 601-612.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        The effective date for the updated Filer Manual and the rule 
    amendments is January 4, 2016. In accordance with the APA,\9\ we find 
    that there is good cause to establish an effective date less than 30 
    days after publication of these rules. The EDGAR system upgrade to 
    Release 15.4 is scheduled to become available on December 14, 2015, and 
    the system upgrade to Release 16.0.1 is
    
    [[Page 5]]
    
    scheduled to become available on January 25, 2016. The Commission 
    believes that establishing an effective date less than 30 days after 
    publication of these rules is necessary to coordinate the effectiveness 
    of the updated Filer Manual with these system upgrades.

        Filers must prepare electronic filings in the manner prescribed by 
    the EDGAR Filer Manual, promulgated by the Commission, which sets out 
    the technical formatting requirements for electronic submissions. The 
    requirements for becoming an EDGAR Filer and updating company data are 
    set forth in the updated EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume I: ``General 
    Information,'' Version 24 (December 2015). The requirements for filing 
    on EDGAR are set forth in the updated EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume II: 
    ``EDGAR Filing,'' Version 35 (December 2015). Additional provisions 
    applicable to Form N-SAR filers are set forth in the EDGAR Filer 
    Manual, Volume III: ``N-SAR Supplement,'' Version 5 (September 2015). 
    All of these provisions have been incorporated by reference into the 
    Code of Federal Regulations, which action was approved by the Director 
    of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR 
    part 51. You must comply with these requirements in order for documents 
    to be timely received and accepted. The EDGAR Filer Manual is available
