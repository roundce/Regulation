    SUMMARY: The Bureau of Prisons (Bureau) removes rules which designated 
    various offenses as sexual offenses for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 4042(c) 
    because that provision, which necessitated regulations, has been 
    repealed in relevant part.
    
    DATES: This rule is effective on February 16, 2016.
    
    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sarah Qureshi, Office of General 
    Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, phone (202) 307-2105.
    
    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bureau removes rules which designated 
    various offenses as sexual offenses for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 4042(c) 
    because that provision, which necessitated regulations, has been 
    repealed in relevant part. The Bureau published a proposed rule on this 
    subject on February 8, 2013 (78 FR 9353). We received no comments on 
    the proposed rule.
        Previously, section 4042(c) of Title 18, United States Code, 
    effective November 26, 1998, provided for notification of sex offender 
    release and certain related functions to facilitate effective sex 
    offender registration and tracking. Notifications were required to be 
    made for persons convicted of the federal offenses noted in subsection 
    (c)(4)(A) through (D). Subsection (c)(4)(E) authorized the Attorney 
    General to designate other offenses as sexual offenses for purposes of 
    subsection (c). The Attorney General delegated this authority to the 
    Director of the Bureau of Prisons. (See 63 FR 69386, December 16, 1998, 
    ``1998 interim rule''.)
        The 1998 interim rule designated additional offenses which are to 
    be considered sexual offenses for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 4042(c). These 
    additional designations, listed in current Sec.  571.72, include state 
    sexual offenses, District of Columbia Code sexual offenses, and certain 
    Uniform Code of Military Justice offenses.
        The regulations, therefore, were specifically promulgated in 
    accordance with language in Sec.  4042(c)(4)(E) providing that offenses 
    in addition to those specifically enumerated at Sec.  4042(c)(4)(A)-(D) 
    may be ``designated by the Attorney General as a sexual offense for the 
    purposes of this subsection.''
        However, 18 U.S.C. 4042(c)(4) was repealed by the Sex Offender 
    Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), which is Title I of the Adam 
    Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-248). 
    Because the revised Sec.  4042(c) requires release notice for persons 
    required to register under SORNA, the Bureau no longer needs to 
    separately designate sexual offenses in addition to those set forth by 
    the statute. The offenses previously listed in the regulation are 
    generally incorporated in SORNA's comprehensive list of covered 
    offenses, thereby rendering the Bureau's current regulations in subpart 
    H of 28 CFR part 571 unnecessary. We therefore now remove and reserve 
    28 CFR part 571, subpart H.
    
    Executive Orders 12866 and 13563--Regulatory Review
    
        This regulation has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with 
    Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' section 1(b), 
    Principles of Regulation and in accordance with Executive Order 13563 
    ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review'' section 1(b) General 
    Principles of Regulation.
        The Department of Justice has determined that this rule is not a 
    ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 
    3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and accordingly this rule has not 
    been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
        Further, both Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to 
    assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, 
    if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that 
    maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, 
    public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). 
    Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both 
    costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of 
    promoting flexibility. The Department has assessed the costs and 
    benefits of this regulation and believes that the regulatory approach 
    selected maximizes net benefits.
    
    Executive Order 13132
    
        This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the 
    States, on the relationship between the national government and the 
    States, or on distribution of power and responsibilities among the 
    various levels of government. Under Executive Order 13132, this rule 
    does not have sufficient federalism implications for which we would 
    prepare a Federalism Assessment.
    
    Regulatory Flexibility Act
    
        The Director of the Bureau of Prisons, under the Regulatory 
    Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), reviewed this regulation. By 
    approving it, the Director certifies that it will not have a 
    significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities 
    because: This rule is about the correctional management of offenders 
    committed to the custody of the Attorney General or the Director of the 
    Bureau of Prisons, and its economic impact is limited to the Bureau's 
    appropriated funds.

    Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995
    
        This rule will not cause State, local and tribal governments, or 
    the private sector, to spend $100,000,000 or more in any one year, and 
    it will not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. We do 
    not need to take action under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.
    
    Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996
    
        This rule is not a major rule as defined by Sec.  804 of the Small 
    Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. This rule will 
    not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more; 
    a major increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse effects on 
    competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on 
    the ability of United States-based companies to compete with foreign-
    based companies in domestic and export markets.
