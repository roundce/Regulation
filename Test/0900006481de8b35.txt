    SUMMARY: NMFS is adjusting the 2016 total allowable catch (TAC) amounts 
    for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) pollock, Atka mackerel, 
    and Pacific cod fisheries. This action is necessary because NMFS has 
    determined these TACs are incorrectly specified, and will ensure the 
    BSAI pollock, Atka mackerel, and Pacific cod TACs are the appropriate 
    amounts based on the best available scientific information. This action 
    is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Fishery Management 
    Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management 
    Area.
    
    DATES: Effective 1200 hrs, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), January 1, 2016, 
    until the effective date of the final 2016 and 2017 harvest 
    specifications for BSAI groundfish, unless otherwise modified or 
    superseded through publication of a notification in the Federal 
    Register.
        Comments must be received at the following address no later than

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the 
    BSAI exclusive economic zone according to the Fishery Management Plan 
    for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area 
    (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under 
    authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management 
    Act. Regulations governing fishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with 
    the FMP appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679.
        The final 2015 and 2016 harvest specifications for groundfish in 
    the BSAI (80 FR 11919, March 5, 2015) set the 2016 Bering Sea (BS) 
    pollock TAC at 1,310,000 metric tons (mt), the 2016 BSAI Atka mackerel 
    TAC at 54,817 mt, the 2016 BS Pacific cod TAC at 240,000 mt, and the AI 
    Pacific cod TAC at 9,422 mt. In December 2015, the North Pacific 
    Fishery Management Council (Council) recommended a 2016 BS pollock TAC 
    of 1,340,000 mt, which is more than the 1,310,000 mt TAC established by 
    the final 2015 and 2016 harvest specifications for groundfish in the 
    BSAI. The Council also recommended a 2016 BSAI Atka mackerel TAC of 
    55,000 mt, which is more than the 54,817 mt TAC established by the 
    final 2015 and 2016 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI. 
    Furthermore, the Council recommended a 2016 BS Pacific cod TAC of 
    238,680 mt, and an AI Pacific cod TAC of 12,839 mt, which is less than 
    the BS Pacific cod TAC of 240,000 mt, and more than the AI Pacific cod 
    TAC of 9,422 mt established by the final 2015 and 2016 harvest 
    specifications for groundfish in the BSAI. The Council's recommended 
    2016 TACs, and the area and seasonal apportionments, are based on the 
    Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation report (SAFE), dated November 
    2015, which NMFS has determined is the best available scientific 
    information for these fisheries.
        Steller sea lions occur in the same location as the pollock, Atka 
    mackerel, and Pacific cod fisheries and are listed as endangered under 
    the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Pollock, Atka mackerel, and Pacific 
    cod are a principal prey species for Steller sea lions in the BSAI. The 
    seasonal apportionment of pollock, Atka mackerel, and Pacific cod 
    harvest is necessary to ensure the groundfish fisheries are not likely 
    to cause jeopardy of extinction or adverse modification of critical 
    habitat for Steller sea lions. NMFS published regulations and the 
    revised harvest limit amounts for Atka mackerel, Pacific cod, and 
    pollock fisheries to implement Steller sea lion protection measures to 
    insure that groundfish fisheries of the BSAI are not likely to 
    jeopardize the continued existence of the western distinct population 
    segment of Steller sea lions or destroy or adversely modify their 
    designated critical habitat (79 FR 70286, November 25, 2014). The 
    regulations at Sec.  679.20(a)(5)(i) specify how the BS pollock TAC 
    will be apportioned. The regulations at Sec.  679.20(a)(7) specify how 
    the BSAI Pacific cod TAC will be apportioned. The regulations at Sec.  
    679.20(a)(8) specify how the BSAI Atka mackerel TAC will be 
    apportioned.
        In accordance with Sec.  679.25(a)(1)(iii), (a)(2)(i)(B), and 
    (a)(2)(iv), the Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional 
    Administrator), has determined that, based on the November 2015 SAFE 
    report for this fishery, the current BSAI pollock, Atka mackerel, and 
    Pacific cod TACs are incorrectly specified. Pursuant to Sec.  
    679.25(a)(1)(iii), the Regional Administrator is adjusting the 2016 BS 
    pollock TAC to 1,340,000 mt, the 2016 BSAI Atka mackerel TAC to 55,000, 
    the 2016 BS Pacific cod TAC to 238,680 mt, and the AI Pacific cod TAC 
    to 12,839 mt. Therefore, Table 2 of the final 2015 and 2016 harvest 
    specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (80 FR 11919, March 5, 2015) 
    is revised consistent with this adjustment.
        Pursuant to Sec.  679.20(a)(5)(i), Table 5 of the final 2015 and 
    2016 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (80 FR 11919, 
    March 5, 2015) is revised for the 2016 BS allocations of pollock TAC to 
    the directed pollock fisheries and to the Community Development Quota 
    (CDQ) directed fishing allowances consistent with this adjustment. The 
    Steller sea lion protection measure final rule (79 FR 70286, November 
    25, 2014), sets harvest limits for pollock in the A season (January 20 
    to June 10) in Areas 543, 542, and 541, see Sec.  
    679.20(a)(5)(iii)(B)(6). In Area 541, the 2016 A season pollock harvest 
    limit is no more than 30 percent, or 9,668 mt, of the AI ABC of 32,227 
    mt. In Area 542, the 2016 A season pollock harvest limit is no more 
    than 15 percent, or 4,834 mt, of the AI ABC of 32,227 mt. In Area 543, 
    the 2016 A season pollock harvest limit is no more than 5 percent, or 
    1,611 mt, of the AI pollock ABC of 32,227 mt.

    \1\ Pursuant to Sec.   679.20(a)(5)(i)(A), the BS subarea pollock, after subtracting the CDQ DFA (10 percent)
      and the ICA (4.0 percent), is allocated as a DFA as follows: Inshore sector--50 percent, catcher/processor
      sector (C/P)--40 percent, and mothership sector--10 percent. In the BS subarea, 40 percent of the DFA is
      allocated to the A season (January 20-June 10) and 60 percent of the DFA is allocated to the B season (June 10-
      November 1). Pursuant to Sec.   679.20(a)(5)(iii)(B)(2)(i) and (ii), the annual AI pollock TAC, after
      subtracting first for the CDQ directed fishing allowance (10 percent) and second the ICA (2,400 mt), is
      allocated to the Aleut Corporation for a pollock directed fishery. In the AI subarea, the A season is
      allocated 40 percent of the ABC and the B season is allocated the remainder of the pollock directed fishery.
    \2\ In the BS subarea, no more than 28 percent of each sector's annual DFA may be taken from the SCA before
      April 1.
    \3\ Pursuant to Sec.   679.20(a)(5)(i)(A)(4), not less than 8.5 percent of the DFA allocated to listed catcher/
      processors shall be available for harvest only by eligible catcher vessels delivering to listed catcher/
      processors.
    \4\ Pursuant to Sec.   679.20(a)(5)(i)(A)(4)(iii), the AFA unlisted catcher/processors are limited to harvesting
      not more than 0.5 percent of the catcher/processors sector's allocation of pollock.
    \5\ Pursuant to Sec.   679.20(a)(5)(i)(A)(6), NMFS establishes an excessive harvesting share limit equal to 17.5
      percent of the sum of the non-CDQ pollock DFAs.
    \6\ Pursuant to Sec.   679.20(a)(5)(i)(A)(7), NMFS establishes an excessive processing share limit equal to 30.0
      percent of the sum of the non-CDQ pollock DFAs.
    \7\ Pursuant to Sec.   679.20(a)(5)(iii)(B)(6), NMFS establishes harvest limits for pollock in the A season in
      Area 541 no more than 30 percent, in Area 542 no more than 15 percent, and in Area 543 no more than 5 percent
      of the Aleutian Islands pollock ABC.
    \8\ The Bogoslof District is closed by the final harvest specifications to directed fishing for pollock. The
      amounts specified are for ICA only and are not apportioned by season or sector.
    Note: Seasonal or sector apportionments may not total precisely due to rounding.
    
        Pursuant to Sec.  679.20(a)(8), Table 7 of the final 2015 and 2016 
    harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (80 FR 11919, March 
    5, 2015) is revised for the 2016 seasonal and spatial allowances, gear 
    shares, CDQ reserve, incidental catch allowance, and Amendment 80 
    allocation of the BSAI Atka mackerel TAC consistent with this 
    adjustment.

    \1\ Section 679.20(a)(8)(ii) allocates the Atka mackerel TACs, after subtracting the CDQ reserves, jig gear
      allocation, and ICAs to the Amendment 80 and BSAI trawl limited access sectors. The allocation of the ITAC for
      Atka mackerel to the Amendment 80 and BSAI trawl limited access sectors is established in Table 33 to part 679
      and Sec.   679.91. The CDQ reserve is 10.7 percent of the TAC for use by CDQ participants (see Sec.  Sec.
      679.20(b)(1)(ii)(C) and 679.31).
    \2\ Regulations at Sec.  Sec.   679.20(a)(8)(ii)(A) and 679.22(a) establish temporal and spatial limitations for
      the Atka mackerel fishery.
    \3\ The seasonal allowances of Atka mackerel are 50 percent in the A season and 50 percent in the B season.
    \4\ Section 679.23(e)(3) authorizes directed fishing for Atka mackerel with trawl gear during the A season from
      January 20 to June 10 and the B season from June 10 to December 31.
    \5\ Section 679.20(a)(8)(ii)(C)(1)(i) limits no more than 60 percent of the annual TACs in Areas 542 and 543 to
      be caught inside of critical habitat; (a)(ii)(C)(1)(ii) equally divides the annual TACs between the A and B
      seasons as defined at Sec.   679.23(e)(3); and (a)(8)(ii)(C)(2) requires the TAC in Area 543 shall be no more
      than 65 percent of ABC.
    \6\ Section 679.20(a)(8)(i) requires that up to 2 percent of the Eastern Aleutian District and the Bering Sea
      subarea TAC be allocated to jig gear after subtracting the CDQ reserve and ICA. The amount of this allocation
      is 0.5 percent. The jig gear allocation is not apportioned by season.
    Note: Seasonal or sector apportionments may not total precisely due to rounding.
    
        Pursuant to Sec.  679.20(a)(7), Table 9 of the final 2015 and 2016 
    harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (80 FR 11919, March 
    5, 2015) is revised for the 2016 gear shares and seasonal allowances of 
    the BSAI Pacific cod TAC consistent with this adjustment.

    \1\ The gear shares and seasonal allowances for BSAI Pacific cod TAC are based on the sum of the BS and AI
      Pacific cod TACs, after the subtraction of CDQ. If the TAC for Pacific cod in either the AI or BS is reached,
      then directed fishing for Pacific cod in that subarea may be prohibited, even if a BSAI allowance remains.
    \2\ The ICA for the hook-and-line and pot sectors will be deducted from the aggregate portion of Pacific cod TAC
      allocated to the hook-and-line and pot sectors. The Regional Administrator approves an ICA of 500 mt for 2016
      based on anticipated incidental catch in these fisheries.
    Note: Seasonal or sector apportionments may not total precisely due to rounding.

        This action responds to the best available information recently 
    obtained from the fishery. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, 
    NOAA (AA), finds good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior 
    notice and opportunity for public comment pursuant to the authority set 
    forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) as such requirement is impracticable and 
    contrary to the public interest. This requirement is impracticable and 
    contrary to the public interest as it would prevent NMFS from 
    responding to the most recent fisheries data in a timely fashion and 
    would allow for harvests that exceed the appropriate allocations for 
    pollock, Atka mackerel, and Pacific cod in the BSAI based on the best 
    scientific information available. NMFS was unable to publish a notice 
    providing time for public comment because the most recent, relevant 
    data only became available as of December 28, 2015, and additional time 
    for prior public comment would result in conservation concerns for the 
    ESA-listed Steller sea lions.
        The AA also finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in the 
    effective date of this action under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). This finding is 
    based upon the reasons provided above for waiver of prior notice and 
    opportunity for public comment.
        Under Sec.  679.25(c)(2), interested persons are invited to submit 
    written comments on this action to the above address until January 16, 
    2015.
        This action is required by Sec.  679.20 and Sec.  679.25 and is 
    exempt from review under Executive Order 12866.
