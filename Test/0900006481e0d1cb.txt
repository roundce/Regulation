    44 CFR Part 64
    
    [Docket ID FEMA-2015-0001; Internal Agency Docket No. FEMA-8417]
    
    
    Suspension of Community Eligibility
    
    AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency, DHS.
    
    ACTION: Final rule.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: This rule identifies communities where the sale of flood 
    insurance has been authorized under the National Flood Insurance 
    Program (NFIP) that are scheduled for suspension on the effective dates 
    listed within this rule because of noncompliance with the floodplain 
    management requirements of the program. If the Federal Emergency 
    Management Agency (FEMA) receives documentation that the community has 
    adopted the required floodplain management measures prior to the 
    effective suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will not 
    occur and a notice of this will be provided by publication in the 
    Federal Register on a subsequent date. Also, information identifying 
    the current participation status of a community can be obtained from 
    FEMA's Community Status Book (CSB). The CSB is available at <http://www.fema.gov/fema/csb.shtm>.
    
    DATES: The effective date of each community's scheduled suspension is 
    the third date (``Susp.'') listed in the third column of the following 
    tables.
    
    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: If you want to determine whether a 
    particular community was suspended on the suspension date or for 
    further information, contact Patricia Suber, Federal Insurance and 
    Mitigation Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C 
    Street SW., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646-4149.
    
    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The NFIP enables property owners to purchase 
    Federal flood insurance that is not otherwise generally available from 
    private insurers. In return, communities agree to adopt and administer 
    local floodplain management measures aimed at protecting lives and new 
    construction
    
    [[Page 1895]]
    
    from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act 
    of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits the sale of NFIP flood 
    insurance unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain 
    management measures with effective enforcement measures. The 
    communities listed in this document no longer meet that statutory 
    requirement for compliance with program regulations, 44 CFR part 59. 
    Accordingly, the communities will be suspended on the effective date in 
    the third column. As of that date, flood insurance will no longer be 
    available in the community. We recognize that some of these communities 
    may adopt and submit the required documentation of legally enforceable 
    floodplain management measures after this rule is published but prior 
    to the actual suspension date. These communities will not be suspended 
    and will continue to be eligible for the sale of NFIP flood insurance. 
    A notice withdrawing the suspension of such communities will be 
    published in the Federal Register.
        In addition, FEMA publishes a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) that 
    identifies the Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) in these communities. 
    The date of the FIRM, if one has been published, is indicated in the 
    fourth column of the table. No direct Federal financial assistance 
    (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief 
    and Emergency Assistance Act not in connection with a flood) may be 
    provided for construction or acquisition of buildings in identified 
    SFHAs for communities not participating in the NFIP and identified for 
    more than a year on FEMA's initial FIRM for the community as having 
    flood-prone areas (section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act 
    of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a), as amended). This prohibition against 
    certain types of Federal assistance becomes effective for the 
    communities listed on the date shown in the last column. The 
    Administrator finds that notice and public comment procedures under 5 
    U.S.C. 553(b), are impracticable and unnecessary because communities 
    listed in this final rule have been adequately notified.
        Each community receives 6-month, 90-day, and 30-day notification 
    letters addressed to the Chief Executive Officer stating that the 
    community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management 
    measures are met prior to the effective suspension date. Since these 
    notifications were made, this final rule may take effect within less 
    than 30 days.
        National Environmental Policy Act. This rule is categorically 
    excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, Environmental 
    Considerations. No environmental impact assessment has been prepared.
        Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Administrator has determined that 
    this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility 
    Act because the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 
    Section 1315, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage unless 
    an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management 
    measures with effective enforcement measures. The communities listed no 
    longer comply with the statutory requirements, and after the effective 
    date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the communities 
    unless remedial action takes place.
        Regulatory Classification. This final rule is not a significant 
    regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 
    12866 of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 
    51735.
        Executive Order 13132, Federalism. This rule involves no policies 
    that have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132.
        Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform. This rule meets the 
    applicable standards of Executive Order 12988.
        Paperwork Reduction Act. This rule does not involve any collection 
    of information for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 
    3501 et seq.
