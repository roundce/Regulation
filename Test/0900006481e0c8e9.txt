    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
    
    40 CFR Parts 52 and 70
    
    [EPA-R07-OAR-2013-0765; FRL-9940-97-Region 7]
    
    
    Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; State of 
    Kansas; Annual Emissions Fee and Annual Emissions Inventory
    
    AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
    
    ACTION: Direct final rule; technical amendment.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) inadvertently 
    approved and codified this action under both part 52 (Approval and 
    Promulgation of Implementation Plans) and part 70 (State Operating 
    Permit Programs). This technical amendment removes the part 52 approval 
    and codification and makes a clarification to part 70.
    
    DATES: This action is effective January 14, 2016.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 27, 2014 (79 FR 4274), EPA 
    published a direct final rule approving a SIP revision for Kansas that 
    included revisions to K.A.R. 28-19-202 ``Annual Emission Fees.'' The 
    rule revision amended KAR 28-19-202 ``Annual Emissions Fees'' to align 
    the state's reporting requirements with EPA's reporting requirements, 
    and was incorrectly approved and codified under part 52 and part 70.
        This rule also included revisions to the operating permits program, 
    K.A.R 28-19-517 ``Class I Operating Permits; Annual Emissions 
    Inventory.'' This part 70 appendix A revision added new paragraph (f) 
    ``The Kansas Department of Health and Environment submitted revisions 
    to Kansas Administrative Record (KAR) 28-19-202 and 28-19-517 on April 
    15, 2011; approval of section (c) effective March 28, 2014.''
        This technical amendment removes the erroneous part 52 approval of 
    KAR 28-19-202 ``Annual Emissions Fees'' and recodifies the table. This 
    action also revises paragraph (f) to read as follows: (f) ``The Kansas 
    Department of Health and Environment submitted revisions to Kansas 
    Administrative Record (KAR) 28-19-202 and 28-19-517 on April 15, 2011; 
    effective March 28, 2014.''
