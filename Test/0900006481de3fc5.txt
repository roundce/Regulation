    [Docket No. CPSC-2011-0081]
    
    
    Amendment To Clarify When Component Part Testing Can Be Used and 
    Which Textile Products Have Been Determined Not To Exceed the Allowable 
    Lead Content Limits; Delay of Effective Date and Reopening of Comment 
    Period
    
    AGENCY: U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.
    
    ACTION: Direct final rule; delay of effective date and reopening of 
    comment period.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The Consumer Product Safety Commission (``Commission'' or 
    ``CPSC'') published a direct final rule (``DFR'') and notice of 
    proposed rulemaking (``NPR'') in the same issue of the Federal Register 
    on October 14, 2015, clarifying when component part testing can be used 
    and clarifying which textile products have been determined not to 
    exceed the allowable lead content limits. Because the comment period 
    deadline for the DFR was stated incorrectly on [regulations.gov](http://regulations.gov), the 
    Commission is reopening the comment period to accept comments submitted 
    by January 13, 2016, and is delaying the effective date of the DFR to 
    February 12, 2016.
    
    DATES: The effective date of the direct final rule published on October 
    14, 2015, at 80 FR 61729, which was delayed from December 14, 2015, 
    until January 13, 2016 by a document published on November 19, 2015 at 
    80

    FR 72342, November 19, 2015, is further delayed from January 13, 2016, 
    until February 12, 2016. The rule will be effective unless we receive a 
    significant adverse comment. If we receive a significant adverse 
    comment, we will publish notification in the Federal Register 
    withdrawing this direct final rule before its effective date. The 
    comment date is extended to January 13, 2016.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 14, 2015, the Commission 
    published a DFR and an NPR in the Federal Register, clarifying when 
    component part testing can be used and clarifying which textile 
    products have been determined not to exceed the allowable lead content 
    limits. (DFR, 80 FR 61729 and NPR, 80 FR 61773). In response to a 
    request for additional time to comment, the Commission published a 
    document extending the comment period until December 14, 2015, and 
    providing that unless the Commission receives a significant adverse 
    comment by December 14, 2015, the rule would become effective on 
    January 13, 2016. 80 FR 72342. The comment period for the DFR was 
    stated incorrectly on [regulations.gov](http://regulations.gov) as January 13, 2016. Therefore, 
    the Commission is publishing this document to reopen the comment period 
    to allow for submission of comments until January 13, 2016, and 
    delaying the effective date, accordingly, to February 12, 2016.
    
        Dated: December 29, 2015.
    Todd A. Stevenson,
    Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission.
