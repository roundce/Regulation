    Approval of Missouri's Air Quality Implementation Plans; Early 
    Progress Plan of the St. Louis Nonattainment Area for the 2008 Ozone 
    National Ambient Air Quality Standard
    
    AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
    
    ACTION: Direct final rule.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking direct 
    final action to approve revisions to the State Implementation Plan 
    (SIP) submitted by the State of Missouri consisting of the Early 
    Progress Plan and motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for volatile 
    organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NOX) for 
    the St. Louis Nonattainment area under the 2008 8-hour National Ambient 
    Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). On August 26, 2013, EPA received from the 
    Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) an Early Progress Plan 
    for the St. Louis area showing progress toward attainment under the 
    2008 Ozone NAAQS. This submittal was developed to establish MVEBs for 
    the St. Louis 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. This approval of the 
    Early Progress Plan for the St. Louis 8-hour ozone nonattainment area 
    fulfills EPA's requirement to act on the MDNR SIP submission and to 
    formalize that the MVEB is approved, and when considered with the 
    emissions from all sources, demonstrates progress toward attainment 
    from the 2008 base year through a 2015 target year. EPA found these 
    MVEBs adequate for transportation conformity purposes in an earlier 
    action on March 5, 2014.
    
    DATES: This direct final rule will be effective March 14, 2016, without 
    further notice, unless EPA receives adverse comment by February 16, 
    2016. If EPA receives adverse comment, we will publish a timely 
    withdrawal of the direct final rule in the Federal Register informing 
    the public that the rule will not take effect.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Throughout this document ``we,'' ``us,'' or 
    ``our'' refer to EPA. This section provides additional information by 
    addressing the following:
    
    I. What is the background for this action?
    II. What are the criteria for early progress plans?
    III. What is EPA's analysis of the request?
    IV. What are the MVEB's for the St. Louis 8-hour ozone area?
    V. What action is EPA taking?
    
    I. What is the background for this action?
    
        EPA's final rule designating nonattainment areas and associated 
    classifications for the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality 
    Standards (NAAQS) was published in the Federal Register on May 21, 2012 
    (77 FR 30088). The St. Louis area was designated as marginal 
    nonattainment. The St. Louis ozone area had previously been designated 
    nonattainment for the 1-hour ozone standard and had 1-hour motor 
    vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for NOX and VOC 
    established in the St. Louis 1-hour maintenance plan SIP (66 FR 33996). 
    The 1-hour MVEBs were the only approved MVEBs for St. Louis and were 
    based on EPA's MOBILE6.2
    
    [[Page 1888]]
    
    emissions model. Consequently, the transportation partners in St. Louis 
    were required to use the 1-hour MVEB test to demonstrate transportation 
    conformity for the 8-hour ozone standard until new MVEBs were approved 
    or found adequate, as required by the transportation conformity rule at 
    40 CFR 93.109(c)(2)(i). Missouri submitted this plan to establish new 8 
    hour MVEBs developed with EPA's current MOVES2014 model.
        EPA allows for the establishment of MVEBs for the 8-hour ozone 
    standard prior to a state submitting its first required 8-hour ozone 
    SIP that would include new MVEBs. Although voluntary, these ``early'' 
    MVEBs must be established through a plan, known as the ``Early Progress 
    Plan,'' that meets all the requirements of a SIP submittal. The 
    preamble of the July 1, 2004, final transportation conformity rule 
    (see, 69 FR 40019) reads as follows:
        ``The first 8-hour ozone SIP could be a control strategy SIP 
    required by the Clean Air Act (e.g., rate-of-progress SIP or attainment 
    demonstration) or a maintenance plan. However, 8-hour ozone 
    nonattainment areas are free to establish, through the SIP process, a 
    motor vehicle emissions budget or budgets that addresses the new NAAQS 
    in advance of a complete SIP attainment demonstration. That is, a state 
    could submit a motor vehicle emission budget that does not demonstrate 
    attainment but is consistent with projections and commitments to 
    control measures and achieves some progress toward attainment (August 
    15, 1997, 62 FR 43799). A SIP submitted earlier than otherwise required 
    can demonstrate a significant level of emissions reductions from 
    current level of emissions, instead of a specific percentage required 
    by the Clean Air Act for moderate and above ozone areas.''
    
    II. What are the criteria for early progress plans?
    
        The Early Progress Plan must demonstrate that the SIP revision 
    containing the MVEBs, when considered with emissions from all sources, 
    and when projected from the base year to a future year, shows some 
    progress toward attainment. EPA has previously indicated that a 5 
    percent to 10 percent reduction in emissions from all sources could 
    represent a significant level of emissions reductions from current 
    levels (69 FR 40019). This allowance is provided so that areas have an 
    opportunity to use the budget test to demonstrate conformity as opposed 
    to the interim conformity tests (i.e., 2002 baseline test and/or action 
    versus baseline test). The budget test with an adequate or approved 
    MVEB budget is generally more protective of air quality and provides a 
    more relevant basis for conformity determinations than the interim 
    emissions test. (69 FR 40026).
        It should also be noted that the Early Progress Plan is not a 
    required plan and does not substitute for required submissions such as 
    an attainment demonstration or rate-of-progress plan, if such plans 
    become required for the St. Louis 8-hour ozone area.
    
    III. What is EPA's analysis of the request?
    
        In August 2013, the State submitted to EPA an Early Progress Plan 
    for the purpose of establishing MVEBs for the St. Louis 8-hour ozone 
    area. The submittal utilizes a base year of 2008, and a projected year 
    of 2015 to establish NOX and VOC MVEBs. The planning 
    assumptions used to develop the MVEBs were discussed and agreed to by 
    the St. Louis interagency consultation group, East West Gateway (EWG), 
    which consists of the transportation and air quality partners in the 
    St. Louis 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. Tables 1 and 2 below show 
    the differences by source categories between the 2008 base year and 
    2015 forecast year. The NOX and VOC emissions in tons per 
    day (tpd) within the St. Louis nonattainment area are expected to 
    decrease significantly, 31 percent and 12 percent, respectively, 
    between 2008 and 2015. These emission trends demonstrate that progress 
    will be made towards attainment of the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS.

        The state submission has met the public notice requirements for SIP 
    submissions in accordance with 40 CFR 51.102. The submission also 
    satisfied the completeness criteria of 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. In 
    addition, the revision meets the substantive SIP requirements of the 
    CAA, including Section 110 and implementing regulations.
    
    IV. What are the MVEB's for the St. Louis 8-hour ozone area?
    
        Through this rulemaking, EPA is approving the 2015 regional MVEBs 
    for NOX and VOC for the St. Louis 8-hour ozone area. EPA has 
    determined that the MVEBs contained in the Early Progress Plan SIP 
    revision are consistent with emission reductions from all sources 
    within the nonattainment area and are showing progress toward 
    attainment.
    
    [[Page 1889]]
    
    The 2015 MVEBs in tpd for VOCs and NOX for the St. Louis, 
    Missouri area are as follows:
    
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            2015 NOX  (tons  2015 VOC  (tons
                                                per day)         per day)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    St. Louis Area MVEB...................           76.70            32.70
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        EPA found these MVEBs adequate for transportation conformity 
    purposes in an earlier action (March 5, 2014, 79 FR 12504). As of March 
    19, 2014, the effective date of EPA's adequacy finding for these MVEBs, 
    conformity determinations in St. Louis must meet the budget test using 
    these 8-hour MVEBs, instead of the 1-hour ozone MVEBs. It should be 
    noted that the previous adequacy finding does not relate to the merits 
    of the SIP submittal, nor does it indicate whether the submittal meets 
    the requirements for approval. This EPA rulemaking action takes formal 
    action on the Early Progress Plan SIP revision.
    
    V. What action is EPA taking?
    
        EPA is taking direct final action to approve this SIP revision. We 
    are publishing this rule without a prior proposed rule because we view 
    this as a noncontroversial action and anticipate no adverse comment. 
    However, in the ``Proposed Rules'' section of this Federal Register, we 
    are publishing a separate document that will serve as the proposed rule 
    to approve this SIP revision, if adverse comments are received on this 
    direct final rule. We will not institute a second comment period on 
    this action. Any parties interested in commenting must do so at this 
    time. For further information about commenting on this rule, see the 
    ADDRESSES section of this document. If EPA receives adverse comment, we 
    will publish a timely withdrawal in the Federal Register informing the 
    public that this direct final rule will not take effect. We will 
    address all public comments in any subsequent final rule based on the 
    proposed rule.
    
    Statutory and Executive Order Reviews
    
        Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP 
    submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable 
    Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in 
    reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state choices, 
    provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this 
    action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and 
    does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state 
    law. For that reason, this action:
         Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review 
    by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 12866 (58 
    FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 2011);
         Does not impose an information collection burden under the 
    provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);
         Is certified as not having a significant economic impact 
    on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory 
    Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
         Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
    uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded 
    Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);
         Does not have Federalism implications as specified in 
    Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);
         Is not an economically significant regulatory action based 
    on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 
    19885, April 23, 1997);
         Is not a significant regulatory action subject to 
    Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);
         Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the 
    National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
    note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent 
    with the Clean Air Act; and
         Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to 
    address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental 
    effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under 
    Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).
        The SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or 
    in any other area where EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a 
    tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does 
    not have tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct 
    costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law as specified by 
    Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).
        The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., as added by the 
    Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally 
    provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating 
    the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, 
    to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the 
    United States. EPA will submit a report containing this action and 
    other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of 
    Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior 
    to publication of the rule in the Federal Register. A major rule cannot 
    take effect until 60 days after it is published in the Federal 
    Register. This action is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 
    804(2).
        Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review 
    of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for 
    the appropriate circuit by March 14, 2016. Filing a petition for 
    reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect 
    the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor 
    does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may 
    be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or 
    action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to 
    enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
