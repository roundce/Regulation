    Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Arkansas; 
    Crittenden County Base Year Emission Inventory
    
    AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
    
    ACTION: Direct final rule.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a 
    revision to the Arkansas State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted to 
    meet the Clean Air Act (CAA) emissions inventory (EI) requirement for 
    the Crittenden County ozone nonattainment area. EPA is approving the 
    SIP revision because it
    
    [[Page 1885]]
    
    satisfies the CAA EI requirement for Crittenden County under the 2008 
    8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The 
    inventory includes emissions data for Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) 
    and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). EPA is approving the revisions 
    pursuant to section 110 and part D of the CAA and EPA's regulations.
    
    DATES: This rule is effective on March 14, 2016 without further notice, 
    unless the EPA receives relevant adverse comment by March 14, 2016. If 
    the EPA receives such comment, the EPA will publish a timely withdrawal 
    in the Federal Register informing the public that this rule will not 
    take effect.

    ``our'' means the EPA.
    
    I. Background
    
    A. The 2008 Ozone NAAQS and Emissions Inventory Requirement
    
        On March 12, 2008, the EPA revised the eight-hour ozone NAAQS from 
    0.08 parts per million (ppm) to 0.075 ppm. (73 FR 16436, March 27, 
    2008). The EPA designated Crittenden County as a nonattainment area for 
    the 2008 ozone NAAQS (77 FR 30088, May 21, 2012).\1\
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \1\ On October 1, 2015, the EPA strengthened the ozone standard 
    to 0.070 ppm (80 FR 65292, October 26, 2015). The EPA has not made 
    designations under this new standard and the emission inventory 
    under evaluation in this rulemaking does not address that standard.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        CAA sections 172(c)(3) and 182(a)(1) require states to develop and 
    submit as a SIP revision an emissions inventory for all areas 
    designated as nonattainment for the ozone NAAQS. 42 U.S.C. 172(c) and 
    182(a). An emissions inventory is an estimation of actual emissions of 
    air pollutants in an area. Ground-level ozone, O3, is a gas 
    that is formed by the reaction of VOCs and NOX in the 
    atmosphere in the presence of sunlight. These precursor emissions are 
    emitted by many types of pollution sources, including power plants and 
    industrial emissions sources, on-road and non-road motor vehicles and 
    engines, and smaller sources, collectively referred to as area sources. 
    The EIs provide data for a variety of air quality planning tasks 
    including establishing baseline emission levels, calculating federally 
    required emission reduction targets, emission inputs into air quality 
    simulation models, and tracking emissions over time. The total EI of 
    VOC and NOX for an area are summarized from the estimates 
    developed for four general categories of emissions sources: Point, 
    area, mobile, and biogenic. The EPA's 2008 ozone standard SIP 
    requirements rule recommends that states use 2011 as a base year to 
    address EI requirements (80 FR 12264, 34190, March 6, 2015).
    
    B. Arkansas' Submittal
    
        On August 28, 2015, Arkansas submitted to the EPA the SIP revision 
    addressing the emissions inventory requirement for Crittenden County 
    under the 2008 ozone NAAQS. The inventory includes estimates of 2011 
    NOX and VOC emissions in tons per year. The 2011 Base Year 
    Inventory is the starting point for calculating the reductions 
    necessary to meet the requirements of the CAA. Sections 172 (c)(3) and 
    182(b)(1) of the CAA require that nonattainment plan provisions include 
    an inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant 
    pollutants in the nonattainment area. The inventory includes all area, 
    point, non-road mobile, and on-road mobile source emissions in the 
    Crittenden County ozone nonattainment area. The inventory also includes 
    a description of the methods used to estimate emissions. A copy of the 
    submittal is available in the electronic docket for this action.
    
    C. What criteria must be met for the EPA to approve this SIP revision?
    
        Section 182(a)(1) of the CAA requires states with nonattainment 
    areas to submit a comprehensive and accurate inventory of ozone 
    precursor emissions from all sources within two years of the effective 
    date of designation, which was July 20, 2012. Also, Section 172(c)(3) 
    requires that such an inventory shall include a comprehensive accurate, 
    current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of the relevant 
    pollutant or pollutants in such area, including such periodic revisions 
    as the Administrator may determine necessary to assure that the 
    requirements of this part are met.
    
    II. The EPA's Evaluation
    
        EPA reviewed the revision for consistency with the requirements of 
    EPA regulations. A summary of EPA's analysis is provided below. For a 
    full discussion of our evaluation, please see our Technical Support 
    Document (TSD).
        Sections 172(c)(3) and 182(a)(1) of the CAA require an inventory of 
    actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the 
    nonattainment area. The 2011 base year emission inventory data include 
    all point, area, and non-road and on-road mobile sources in Crittenden 
    County. Point source emissions were entered through the State and Local 
    Emissions Inventory System (SLEIS) and area sources were developed in 
    accordance with the federal Air Emissions Reporting Requirements (AERR) 
    rule. Non-road mobile sources utilized the National Mobile Inventory 
    Model (NMIM) while the on-road sources used the Motor Vehicle Emissions 
    Simulator (MOVES2010b). The EPA has determined that the inventory was 
    developed in accordance with CAA guidelines and that the revised 2011 
    base year emission inventory is approvable. The submittal meets the 
    goal of reaching attainment by reducing O3 forming 
    precursors. Table 1 lists the emissions inventory for the Crittenden 
    County area. For more detail on how the
    
    [[Page 1886]]
    
    emissions inventories were estimated and evaluated, see the TSD.

    III. Final Action
    
        We are approving revisions to the Arkansas SIP that pertain to the 
    2008 ozone SIP emissions inventory for Crittenden County, as are listed 
    in Table 1.
        The EPA is publishing this rule without prior proposal because we 
    view this as a non-controversial amendment and anticipate no adverse 
    comments. However, in the proposed rules section of this Federal 
    Register publication, we are publishing a separate document that will 
    serve as the proposal to approve the SIP revision if relevant adverse 
    comments are received. This rule will be effective on March 14, 2016 
    without further notice unless we receive relevant adverse comment by 
    February 16, 2016. If we receive relevant adverse comments, we will 
    publish a timely withdrawal in the Federal Register informing the 
    public that the rule will not take effect. We will address all public 
    comments in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule. We will 
    not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties 
    interested in commenting must do so now. Please note that if we receive 
    relevant adverse comment on an amendment, paragraph, or section of this 
    rule and if that provision may be severed from the remainder of the 
    rule, we may adopt as final those provisions of the rule that are not 
    the subject of an adverse comment.
    
    IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews
    
        Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP 
    submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable 
    Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in 
    reviewing SIP submissions, the EPA's role is to approve state choices, 
    provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this 
    action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and 
    does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state 
    law. For that reason, this action:
         Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' subject to 
    review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 
    12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 
    2011);
         Does not impose an information collection burden under the 
    provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);
         Is certified as not having a significant economic impact 
    on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory 
    Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
         Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
    uniquely affect small governments, described in the Unfunded Mandates 
    Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);
         Does not have Federalism implications as specified in 
    Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);
         Is not an economically significant regulatory action based 
    on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 
    19885, April 23, 1997);
         Is not a significant regulatory action subject to 
    Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);
         Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the 
    National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
    note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent 
    with the CAA; and
         Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to 
    address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental 
    effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under 
    Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).
    
    In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation 
    land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated 
    that a tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the 
    rule does not have tribal implications and will not impose substantial 
    direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law as specified 
    by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).
        The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., as added by the 
    Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally 
    provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating 
    the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, 
    to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the 
    United States. The EPA will submit a report containing this rule and 
    other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of 
    Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior 
    to publication of the rule in the Federal Register. A major rule cannot 
    take effect until 60 days after it is published in the Federal 
    Register. This action is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 
    804(2).
        Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review 
    of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for 
    the appropriate circuit by March 14, 2016. Filing a petition for 
    reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect 
    the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does 
    it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be 
    filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. 
    This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its 
    requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
