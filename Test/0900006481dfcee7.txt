    AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
    
    ACTION: Direct final rule.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking direct 
    final action to remove outdated rules in the Code of Federal 
    Regulations (CFR) for the State of Washington because they are 
    unnecessary or obsolete. The EPA is also clarifying regulations to 
    reflect updated citations and more recent air quality monitoring data. 
    This direct final action makes no substantive changes to the State 
    Implementation Plan (SIP) and imposes no new requirements.
    
    DATES: This rule is effective on March 11, 2016, without further 
    notice, unless the EPA receives adverse comment by February 10, 2016. 
    If the EPA receives adverse comment, we will publish a timely 
    withdrawal in the Federal Register informing the public that the rule 
    will not take effect.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Throughout this document whenever ``we,'' 
    ``us,'' or ``our'' are used, it is intended to refer to the EPA.
    
    I. Introduction
    
        This action is being taken pursuant to Executive Order 13563--
    Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review. It is intended to reduce 
    the number of pages in the CFR by identifying those rules in 40 CFR 
    part 52, subpart WW, for the State of Washington that are duplicative, 
    outdated, or obsolete. These rules no longer have any use or legal 
    effect because they have been superseded by subsequently approved SIP 
    revisions. This action also amends certain rules by revising outdated 
    citations and updating provisions based on more recent ambient air 
    quality monitoring data. One aspect of the EPA's action removes 
    historical information found in the ``Original Identification of plan'' 
    section in 40 CFR 52.2477. This section is no longer necessary because 
    the EPA promulgated administrative rule actions to replace these 
    paragraphs with summary tables in 40 CFR 52.2470 (78 FR 17108, March 
    20, 2013). These summary tables describe the regulations, source-
    specific actions, and non-regulatory requirements which comprise the 
    SIP.
    
    II. Removal of Obsolete or Unnecessary Rules and Clarifications to 
    Certain Rules
    
        The EPA reviewed the following regulations and found that they 
    should be removed or revised for the reasons set forth as follows:
    
    [[Page 1129]]
    
    A. Section 52.2471 Classification of Regions
    
        In a submission received on September 22, 2014, included in the 
    docket for this action, the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) 
    reviewed air quality monitoring data for nitrogen dioxide 
    (NO2) and ozone with respect to classifying regions under 40 
    CFR 51.150. That section classifies regions based on air quality 
    information for purposes of establishing requirements for emergency 
    episode plans. The air quality information in 40 CFR 52.2471 regarding 
    classification of regions in the State of Washington was last updated 
    by the EPA on June 5, 1980 (45 FR 37836). Ecology confirmed that the 
    classifications in Sec.  52.2471 remain correct for NO2 
    based on 2012-2014 monitoring data. Ecology also confirmed that the 
    classifications for ozone remain correct for all Air Quality Control 
    Regions in Washington, except one. Based on a review of 2012-2014 data, 
    Ecology noted that the classification for the Washington portion of the 
    Portland Interstate Air Quality Control Region is out of date. The EPA 
    reviewed the 2012-2014 data used by Ecology, as well as more recent 
    2013-2015 data included in the docket for this action. We agree with 
    Ecology's analysis that the Washington portion of the Portland 
    Interstate Air Quality Control Region should be reclassified to 
    Priority III based on more recent air quality monitoring data. The 
    reclassification of the Washington portion of the Portland Interstate 
    Air Quality Control Region from Priority I to Priority III will have no 
    significant impact on the SIP because the current emergency episode 
    plan covers the entire state and remains unchanged in the SIP since the 
    EPA's last approval (58 FR 4578, January 15, 1993).
        The EPA also reviewed air quality monitoring data for carbon 
    monoxide. Concentrations of carbon monoxide in ambient air have 
    plummeted in the thirty-five years since the EPA's last update to the 
    classifications in Sec.  52.2471, primarily due to improved Federal 
    engine standards for motor vehicles. The highest 8-hour concentration 
    observed at all monitors in Washington from 2013-2015 was 2.4 parts per 
    million (ppm), which is well below the 8-hour carbon monoxide National 
    Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 9 ppm and well below the 
    Priority I classification level of 12 ppm. Similarly, the highest 1-
    hour concentration observed at all monitors in Washington from 2013-
    2015 was 4 ppm, which is well below the 1-hour carbon monoxide NAAQS of 
    35 ppm and well below the Priority I classification level of 48 ppm. 
    The EPA is therefore reclassifying all carbon monoxide areas in 
    Washington as Priority III, the lowest classification level. As 
    discussed above, this update to the classification levels will have no 
    significant impact on the SIP because the current emergency episode 
    plan covering the entire state remains unchanged in the SIP since the 
    EPA's last approval. At this time, we are not assessing the 
    classification levels for other pollutants (particulate matter and 
    sulfur dioxide) because the data analysis required to do so, including 
    consideration of any potential exceptional events, is beyond the scope 
    of this action.
    
    B. Section 52.2472 Extensions
    
        This section extended the attainment date for the Spokane and 
    Wallula particulate matter (PM10) nonattainment areas until 
    December 31, 1995 (60 FR 47280, September 12, 1995). In subsequent 
    actions, the EPA redesignated both of these areas to attainment of the 
    PM10 NAAQS (70 FR 38029, July 1, 2005 and 70 FR 50212, 
    August 26, 2005), making this section obsolete. The EPA is therefore 
    removing this section.
    
    C. Section 52.2473 Approval Status
    
        This section, last updated February 23, 1982 (47 FR 7840), is out 
    of date. The second sentence addresses the geographic applicability of 
    the regulations in the Washington SIP. Applicability is now addressed 
    in the tables in Sec.  52.2470, and this sentence is out of date and is 
    being removed (see 79 FR 59653, October 3, 2014). The fourth sentence 
    describes ozone-related reasonably available control technology (RACT) 
    requirements under the 1977 Clean Air Act (CAA). This sentence is being 
    removed because the EPA subsequently approved Washington SIP revisions 
    for the ozone NAAQS under the requirements of the 1990 CAA (see 40 CFR 
    52.2470(c) and (e)). Similarly, the fifth sentence in this section is 
    also out of date and is being removed. It describes the requirements of 
    the emission offset interpretive rule as it applies to permitting new 
    sources in a nonattainment area, published January 16, 1979 (44 FR 
    3274). This concern became obsolete when the EPA approved Washington 
    Administrative Code (WAC) 173-400-091 ``Voluntary limits on emissions'' 
    and WAC 173-400-112 ``Requirements for new sources in nonattainment 
    areas'' (60 FR 28726, June 2, 1995). More recently, the EPA approved 
    updates to Washington's nonattainment new source review permitting 
    program as meeting all CAA requirements on November 7, 2014 (79 FR 
    59653).
    
    D. Section 52.2474 General Requirements
    
        This section, addressing public availability of emission data, is 
    out of date (40 FR 55334, November 28, 1975), and is being removed. On 
    October 3, 2014, the EPA approved WAC 173-400-175 ``Public 
    Information'' as meeting the requirements of the CAA, including making 
    ambient air quality data and emission data available to the public (79 
    FR 59653). For a full discussion, please see the proposed approval of 
    WAC 173-400-175 (79 FR 39351, 39357, July 10, 2014).
    
    E. Section 52.2475 Approval of Plans
    
        This section is no longer necessary because the EPA replaced the 
    historical information contained in this section with summary tables in 
    Sec.  52.2470 (78 FR 17108, March 20, 2013). These summary tables 
    describe the regulations, source-specific actions, and non-regulatory 
    requirements which comprise the SIP, including a history of attainment 
    plan and visibility protection SIP submittals. The EPA reviewed Sec.  
    52.2475 to verify that all relevant historical information in this 
    section is contained in Sec.  52.2470. The EPA is therefore removing 
    Sec.  52.2475.
    
    F. Section 52.2477 Original Identification of Plan Section
    
        Paragraphs (b) and (c) of Sec.  52.2477, originally designated as 
    40 CFR 52.2470(b) and (c), contain historical information about the 
    EPA's approval actions for the Washington SIP which occurred from 
    January 28, 1972 until March 20, 2013. On March 20, 2013, the EPA 
    reorganized the Identification of plan section (Sec.  52.2470) for 
    subpart WW by listing and summarizing Washington's currently approved 
    SIP requirements in Sec.  52.2470(a) through (e) (78 FR 17110). 
    Paragraphs (b) and (c) of Sec.  52.2477 are being removed because the 
    EPA has determined that it is no longer necessary to codify the 
    information found in these paragraphs. Paragraph (a) of Sec.  52.2477 
    is being amended to state that this historical information will 
    continue to be made available in the CFR annual editions, title 40, 
    part 52 (years 1996 through 2012). These annual editions are available 
    on line at the following url address: <http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionCfr.action?collectionCode=CFR>.
    
    [[Page 1130]]
    
    G. Section 52.2495 Voluntary Limits on Potential To Emit
    
        This section discusses the mechanisms for issuance of voluntary 
    limits on potential to emit in Washington. In 1995, the EPA approved 
    this regulation (with a state effective date of September 20, 1993) as 
    meeting the requirements for Federally-enforceable state operating 
    permit programs set forth in 54 FR 27274 (June 28, 1989), with respect 
    to criteria pollutants and pollutants regulated under the PSD program 
    under section 110 of the CAA (as part of the SIP) and with respect to 
    hazardous air pollutants under section 112(l) of the CAA (as part of 
    Ecology's CAA section 112 program and not as part of the SIP). See 60 
    FR 9805 (proposed action); 60 FR 28726 (final action). Subsequent to 
    that approval, Ecology made minor changes to WAC 173-400-091. The EPA 
    approved these minor changes to the Washington SIP in 2014 with respect 
    to criteria pollutants and pollutants regulated under the PSD program 
    (referred to as ``regulated NSR pollutants''). See 79 FR 39351, 39354 
    (July 10, 2014) (proposed action); 79 FR 59653 (final action). The 1993 
    version of WAC 173-400-091 continues to be the approved version for 
    purposes of section 112(l). The EPA is amending Sec.  52.2495 to make 
    it clear that WAC 173-400-091 remains approved under both sections 110 
    and 112(l) of the CAA, and that the SIP-approved version is identified 
    in Sec.  52.2470(c). The EPA is also deleting the reference in Sec.  
    52.2495 to 40 CFR 51.104(e) because that paragraph has been repealed.
    
    III. Final Action
    
        The EPA has determined that the above referenced rules should be 
    removed or revised at this time. The EPA is publishing this rule 
    without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a 
    noncontroversial action and anticipates no adverse comment. However, in 
    the ``Proposed Rules'' section of this Federal Register, the EPA is 
    publishing a separate document that will serve as the proposal to 
    approve the SIP revision if adverse comments are filed. This rule will 
    be effective on March 11, 2016 without further notice unless the EPA 
    receives adverse comment by February 10, 2016. If the EPA receives 
    adverse comment, the EPA will publish a timely withdrawal in the 
    Federal Register informing the public that the rule will not take 
    effect. The EPA will address all public comments in a subsequent final 
    rule based on the proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second 
    comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting 
    must do so at this time. Please note that if the EPA receives adverse 
    comment on an amendment, paragraph, or section of this rule and if that 
    provision may be severed from the remainder of the rule, the EPA may 
    adopt as final those provisions of the rule that are not the subject of 
    an adverse comment.
    
    IV. Statutory and Executive Orders Reviews
    
        Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a 
    SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and 
    applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). 
    Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, the EPA's role is to approve state 
    choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. 
    Accordingly, this action merely approves state law as meeting Federal 
    requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those 
    imposed by state law. For that reason, this action:
         Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' subject to 
    review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 
    12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 
    2011);
         does not impose an information collection burden under the 
    provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);
         is certified as not having a significant economic impact 
    on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory 
    Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
         does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
    uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded 
    Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);
         does not have Federalism implications as specified in 
    Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);
         is not an economically significant regulatory action based 
    on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 
    19885, April 23, 1997);
         is not a significant regulatory action subject to 
    Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);
         is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the 
    National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
    note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent 
    with the Clean Air Act; and
         does not provide the EPA with the discretionary authority 
    to address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or 
    environmental effects, using practicable and legally permissible 
    methods, under Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).
        The SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land in 
    Washington except as specifically noted below and is also not approved 
    to apply in any other area where the EPA or an Indian tribe has 
    demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian 
    country, the rule does not have tribal implications as specified by 
    Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). Washington's SIP 
    is approved to apply on non-trust land within the exterior boundaries 
    of the Puyallup Indian Reservation, also known as the 1873 Survey Area. 
    Under the Puyallup Tribe of Indians Settlement Act of 1989, 25 U.S.C. 
    1773, Congress explicitly provided state and local agencies in 
    Washington authority over activities on non-trust lands within the 1873 
    Survey Area.
        The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., as added by the 
    Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally 
    provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating 
    the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, 
    to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the 
    United States. The EPA will submit a report containing this action and 
    other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of 
    Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior 
    to publication of the rule in the Federal Register. A major rule cannot 
    take effect until 60 days after it is published in the Federal 
    Register. This action is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 
    804(2).
        Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for 
    judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court 
    of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 11, 2016. Filing a 
    petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule 
    does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of 
    judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for 
    judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness 
    of such rule or action. Parties with objections to this direct final 
    rule are encouraged to file a comment in response to the parallel 
    notice of proposed rulemaking for this action published in the proposed 
    rules section of this Federal Register, rather than file an immediate 
    petition for judicial review of this direct final rule, so that the EPA 
    can withdraw this direct final rule and address the comment in the
    
    [[Page 1131]]
    
    proposed rulemaking. This action may not be challenged later in 
    proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
