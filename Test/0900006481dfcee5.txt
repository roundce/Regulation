    33 CFR Part 117
    
    [Docket No. USCG-2015-1119]
    
    
    Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, 
    New Orleans, LA
    
    AGENCY: Coast Guard, DHS.
    
    ACTION: Notice of deviation from drawbridge regulation.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The Coast Guard has issued a temporary deviation from the 
    operating schedule that governs the US 90 (Danziger) vertical lift span 
    drawbridge across the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, mile 3.10 at New 
    Orleans, Orleans Parish, Louisiana. The deviation is necessary to 
    conduct field measurements and other preparations for repairs and 
    maintenance that are scheduled for later in the year. This deviation 
    allows the bridge to remain closed-to-navigation for nine days. During 
    this closure, the bridge will open with at least four hours notice 
    except during scheduled curfew times.
    
    DATES: This deviation is effective from 7 p.m. on January 22, 2016, 
    until 7 p.m. on January 31, 2016.
    
    ADDRESSES: The docket for this deviation, [USCG-2015-1119] is available 
    at <http://www.regulations.gov>.
    
    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: If you have questions on this 
    temporary deviation, call or email Jim Wetherington, Bridge 
    Administration Branch, Coast Guard, telephone (504) 671-2128, email 
    [james.r.wetherington@uscg.mil](mailto:james.r.wetherington@uscg.mil).
    
    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Contractor, C.E.C., Inc., for the 
    Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LDOTD), 
    requested a temporary deviation from the operating schedule of the US 
    90 (Danziger) vertical lift span drawbridge across the Inner Harbor 
    Navigation Canal, mile 3.10 at New Orleans, Orleans Parish, Louisiana. 
    The deviation was requested for the purpose of conducting field 
    measurements and other preparations for repairs and maintenance that 
    are scheduled for later in the year. The vertical clearance of the 
    vertical lift span bridge is 50 feet above mean high water in the 
    closed-to-navigation position and 120 feet in the open-to-navigation 
    position. The bridge is governed by 33 CFR 117.458(b).
        This deviation is effective from 7 p.m. on January 22, 2016, until 
    7 p.m. on January 31, 2016. This deviation allows
    
    [[Page 1122]]
    
    the bridge to remain closed-to-navigation daily except that the bridge 
    will open if at least four hours notice is given except Monday through 
    Friday from 7 a.m.-8:30 a.m. and from 5 p.m.-6:30 p.m., daily. During 
    the closure period, the contractor will make every effort to minimize 
    the delays to mariners by opening the bridge with less than four hour 
    notice whenever possible. However, the bridge is not required to open 
    with less than a four-hour notice. Marine traffic, when allowed to 
    pass, should pass at the slowest safe speed.
        Navigation on the waterway consists of small tugs with and without 
    tows, commercial vessels, and recreational craft, including sailboats.
        Vessels able to pass through the bridge in the closed-to-navigation 
    position may do so at anytime. The bridge will be able to open for 
    emergencies, and there is no immediate alternate route. The Coast Guard 
    will also inform the users of the waterways through our Local and 
    Broadcast Notices to Mariners of the change in operating schedule for 
    the bridge so that vessels can arrange their transits to minimize any 
    impact caused by the temporary deviation.
        In accordance with 33 CFR 117.35(e), the drawbridge must return to 
    its regular operating schedule immediately at the end of the effective 
    period of this temporary deviation. This deviation from the operating 
    regulations is authorized under 33 CFR 117.35.
    
        Dated: January 5, 2016.
    David M. Frank,
    Bridge Administrator, Eighth Coast Guard District.
