    SUMMARY: This regulation establishes a time-limited exemption from the 
    Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) section 408(a) requirement 
    of a tolerance for residues of the pesticide Aspergillus flavus AF36 in 
    or on dried figs resulting from use in accordance
    
    [[Page 1891]]
    
    with the terms of an emergency exemption issued under section 18 of the 
    Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This 
    action is in response to the issuance of a crisis emergency exemption 
    under FIFRA section 18 authorizing use of the pesticide on dried figs. 
    The time-limited exemption from the requirement of a tolerance expires 
    on December 31, 2017.

    II. Background and Statutory Findings
    
        EPA, on its own initiative, in accordance with FFDCA sections 
    408(e) and 408(l)(6), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e) and 346a(1)(6), is establishing 
    a time-limited exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for 
    residues of Aspergillus flavus AF36, in or on dried figs. This time-
    limited exemption from the requirement of a tolerance expires on 
    December 31, 2017.
        Section 408(l)(6) of FFDCA requires EPA to establish a time-limited 
    tolerance or exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for 
    pesticide chemical residues in food that will result from the use of a 
    pesticide under an emergency exemption granted by EPA under FIFRA 
    section 18. Such tolerances or exemptions from the requirement of a 
    tolerance must be consistent with the safety standard in 408(b)(2) and 
    (c)(2), respectively, and can be established without providing notice 
    or period for public comment. EPA does not intend for its actions on 
    FIFRA section 18 related time-limited tolerances or exemptions from the 
    requirement of a tolerance to set binding precedents for the 
    application of FFDCA section 408 and the safety standard to other 
    tolerances and exemptions. Section 408(e) of FFDCA allows EPA to 
    establish a tolerance or an exemption from the requirement of a 
    tolerance on its own initiative, i.e., without having received any 
    petition from an outside party.
        Section 408(c)(2)(A)(i) of FFDCA allows EPA to establish an 
    exemption from the requirement of a tolerance (the legal limit for a 
    pesticide chemical residue in or on a food) only if EPA determines that 
    the exemption is ``safe.'' Section 408(c)(2)(A)(ii) of FFDCA defines 
    ``safe'' to mean that ``there is a reasonable certainty that no harm 
    will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue, 
    including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for 
    which there is reliable information.'' This includes exposure through 
    drinking water and in residential settings, but does not include 
    occupational exposure. In evaluating the safety of an exemption, 
    section 408(c)(2)(B) requires EPA to take into account the 
    considerations set forth in 408(b)(2)(C) and (D). Section 408(b)(2)(C) 
    of FFDCA requires EPA to give special consideration to exposure of 
    infants and children to the pesticide chemical residue in establishing 
    a tolerance and to ``ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that 
    no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to 
    the pesticide chemical residue. . . .''
    
    [[Page 1892]]
    
        Section 18 of FIFRA authorizes EPA to exempt any Federal or State 
    agency from any provision of FIFRA, if EPA determines that ``emergency 
    conditions exist which require such exemption.'' EPA has established 
    regulations governing such emergency exemptions in 40 CFR part 166.
    
    III. Emergency Exemption for Aspergillus flavus AF36 on Dried Figs and 
    FFDCA Tolerances
    
        The California Department of Pesticide Regulation asserted that an 
    emergency condition, brought on by an ongoing drought in California, 
    existed in accordance with the criteria for approval of an emergency 
    exemption, and utilized a crisis exemption under FIFRA section 18 to 
    allow the use of Aspergillus flavus AF36 to reduce aflatoxin-producing 
    fungi on dried figs in California. The California Department of 
    Pesticide Regulation invoked the crisis exemption provision on June 15, 
    2015. After having reviewed the crisis exemption, EPA concurred on the 
    emergency action in order to meet the emergency needs of fig growers in 
    California. The crisis exemption program expired on July 31, 2015.
        As part of its evaluation of the emergency exemption application, 
    EPA assessed the potential risks presented by residues of Aspergillus 
    flavus AF36 in or on dried figs. In doing so, EPA considered the safety 
    standard in FFDCA section 408(c)(2), and EPA decided that the necessary 
    exemption from the requirement of a tolerance under FFDCA section 
    408(l)(6) would be consistent with the safety standard and with FIFRA 
    section 18. Consistent with the need to move quickly on the crisis 
    exemption in order to address an urgent, non-routine situation and to 
    ensure that the resulting food is safe and lawful, EPA is issuing this 
    exemption from the requirement of a tolerance without notice and 
    opportunity for public comment as provided in FFDCA section 408(l)(6). 
    This time-limited exemption from the requirement of a tolerance expires 
    on December 31, 2017. EPA will take action to revoke the time-limited 
    exemption from the requirement of a tolerance earlier if any experience 
    with scientific data, or other relevant information on this pesticide 
    indicates that the residues are not safe.
        Because this time-limited exemption from the requirement of a 
    tolerance is being approved under emergency conditions, EPA has not 
    made any decisions about whether Aspergillus flavus AF36 meets FIFRA's 
    registration requirements for use on dried figs or whether permanent 
    tolerances or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for this 
    use would be appropriate. Under these circumstances, EPA does not 
    believe that this time-limited exemption from the requirement of a 
    tolerance serves as a basis for registration of Aspergillus flavus AF36 
    by a State for special local needs under FIFRA section 24(c). Nor does 
    this exemption from the requirement of a tolerance by itself serve as 
    the authority for persons in any State other than California to use 
    this pesticide on the applicable crop under FIFRA section 18 absent the 
    issuance of an emergency exemption applicable within that State. For 
    additional information regarding the crisis exemption for Aspergillus 
    flavus AF36, contact the Agency's Registration Division at the address 
    provided under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.
    
    IV. Toxicological Profile
    
        Consistent with the FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(D), the EPA reviewed 
    the available scientific data and other relevant information for 
    Aspergillus flavus AF36, and considered its validity, completeness, and 
    reliability, as well as the relationship of this information to human 
    risk. The EPA also considered available information concerning the 
    variability of the sensitivities of major identifiable subgroups of 
    consumers, including infants and children.
        Aspergillus flavus refers to a diverse group of saprophytic soil 
    fungi strains, which are ubiquitously distributed throughout the United 
    States. This fungal group includes strains that produce aflatoxin 
    (i.e., toxigenic strains) and strains that do not produce aflatoxins 
    (i.e., atoxigenic strains). The toxigenic strains can cause aflatoxin 
    contamination in seed, nut, and grain crops pre- and postharvest. In 
    addition, toxigenic strains of several Aspergillus spp. can cause 
    aspergillosis disease in humans (Ref. 1, 2).
        Aspergillus flavus AF36 is an atoxigenic strain registered as a 
    microbial pesticide for use on cotton, corn, and pistachios. The AF36 
    strain is a soil colonizing fungus and displaces toxigenic strains 
    through competition, thereby reducing aflatoxin levels on crops 
    contaminated with toxigenic strains of Aspergillus spp. (Ref. 3).
        The toxicological profile of Aspergillus flavus were previously 
    described in the Federal Register July 14, 2003 (68 FR 41535) (FRL-
    7311-6) and the data were used to establish the tolerance exemption for 
    Aspergillus flavus AF36 in or on cotton (see the Federal Register of 
    July 14, 2003), corn (see the Federal Register of March 23, 2011 (76 FR 
    16297) (FRL-8868-7)), and pistachio (see the Federal Register of March 
    9, 2012 (77 FR 14287) (FRL-9341-5). The studies used to establish the 
    tolerance exemptions in or on cotton, corn, and pistachio tested the 
    toxicity/pathogenicity of Aspergillus flavus AF36 to rats through acute 
    oral and pulmonary exposures and did not find any evidence of toxicity 
    or infection (Ref. 1). Further, when exposed through intratracheal 
    dosing, rats cleared Aspergillus flavus AF36 from their systems within 
    8 days. Moreover, rats exposed to Aspergillus flavus AF36 cleared the 
    fungus from their body without compromising their immune system. After 
    more than a decade of agricultural use in cotton and several years of 
    use in corn and pistachio, there have not been any reports of 
    hypersensitivity or other problems from workers exposed to Aspergillus 
    flavus AF36. Therefore, based on the atoxigenic profile of Aspergillus 
    flavus AF36, and previous toxicological evaluations to establish 
    tolerance exemptions in or on cotton (see the Federal Register of July 
    14, 2003), corn (see the Federal Register of March 23, 2011), and 
    pistachio (see the Federal Register of March 9, 2012), EPA concludes 
    that there are no toxicological endpoints of concern for Aspergillus 
    flavus AF36 and that there are no hazards associated with this 
    particular isolate; therefore, any expected residues on food would be 
    safe to consume.
    
    V. Aggregate Exposure
    
        In examining aggregate exposure, FFDCA section 408 directs the EPA 
    to consider available information concerning exposures from the 
    pesticide residue in food and all other non-occupational exposures, 
    including drinking water from ground water or surface water and 
    exposure through pesticide use in gardens, lawns, or buildings 
    (residential and other indoor uses).
        Food exposure: Aspergillus flavus AF36 will be applied as a single 
    broadcast application to soil in California fig orchards from mid-June 
    to mid-July 2015. The proposed method of application is by grain seed 
    (wheat-infested Aspergillus flavus AF36 inoculum) applied to the 
    orchard floor by ground. Grain seed inoculum is directed under the fig 
    tree canopy where soil is wetted before and after the application. 
    After application, Aspergillus flavus AF36 germinates using a grain 
    carrier as a nutrient source and displaces aflatoxin-producing strains 
    of Aspergillus flavus. Thus, the use of Aspergillus flavus AF36 in fig 
    orchards should not increase the total Aspergillus flavus population in 
    the environment (Ref. 1). Although, total Aspergillus flavus 
    populations may
    
    [[Page 1893]]
    
    increase immediately after applying Aspergillus flavus AF36, 
    populations of Aspergillus flavus AF36 decline by spring of the year 
    after application and there is no evidence of long term increases in 
    populations of Aspergillus flavus resulting from application of 
    Aspergillus flavus AF36. In addition, levels of natural Aspergillus 
    flavus populations can fluctuate greatly over the course of a year 
    (Ref. 1). Therefore, a temporary increase in Aspergillus flavus 
    populations resulting from an application of Aspergillus flavus AF36 
    are not expected to produce effects that do not already occur from 
    exposure to natural Aspergillus flavus populations.
        Drinking water exposure: Similar to previous drinking water 
    exposures for cotton and corn uses (see Federal Register of July 14, 
    2003 and March 23, 2011) exposure to residues of Aspergillus flavus 
    AF36 ensuing from application in fig orchards is possible as a result 
    of consuming drinking water, but it is not likely to be greater than 
    existing exposures to naturally occurring strains of Aspergillus flavus 
    AF36. This time-limited exemption from the requirement of a tolerance 
    will only allow for applications in California in an area where the 
    climate is arid, which minimizes the potential for contamination of 
    surface or ground water that may serve as a source of drinking water. 
    Further, because Aspergillus flavus AF36 will only be applied as a 
    granular formulation to terrestrial sites, offsite movement into water 
    is not anticipated. If Aspergillus flavus AF36 residues should be 
    present in drinking water, the results of a study assessing acute oral 
    toxicity and pathogenicity found that no toxicity, pathogenicity, and/
    or infectivity is likely to occur from exposure to any level of 
    Aspergillus flavus AF36 resulting from an application of Aspergillus 
    flavus AF36 made in accordance with good agricultural practice.
        Other non-occupational exposure: Non-occupational dermal and 
    inhalation exposure is expected to be minimal to non-existent for the 
    use of Aspergillus flavus AF36 on figs. As previously described in the 
    Federal Register of July 14, 2003, March 23, 2011, and March 9, 2012; 
    Aspergillus flavus AF36 will be applied to agricultural sites and not 
    in the proximity of schools, residential areas, nursing homes, or 
    daycare facilities. Moreover, Aspergillus flavus AF36 will be applied 
    in a granular form which will minimize drift and exposure.
    
    VI. Cumulative Effects From Substances With a Common Mechanism of 
    Toxicity
    
        Section 408(b)(2)(D)(v) of FFDCA requires that, when considering 
    whether to establish, modify, or revoke a tolerance, the EPA consider 
    ``available information concerning the cumulative effects of a 
    particular pesticide's . . . residues and other substances that have a 
    common mechanism of toxicity.''
        The EPA has not found Aspergillus flavus AF36 to share a common 
    mechanism of toxicity with any other substances, and Aspergillus flavus 
    AF36 does not appear to produce a toxic metabolite produced by other 
    substances. For the purposes of this exemption from the requirement of 
    a tolerance action, therefore, the EPA has assumed that Aspergillus 
    flavus AF36 does not have a common mechanism of toxicity with other 
    substances since there is no indication of mammalian toxicity or 
    pathogenicity resulting from exposure to Aspergillus flavus AF36. For 
    information regarding the EPA's efforts to determine chemicals that 
    have a common mechanism of toxicity and to evaluate the cumulative 
    effects of such chemicals, see the EPA's Web site at <http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/cumulative>.
    
    VII. Determination of Safety for the U.S. Population, Infants and 
    Children
    
        In considering the establishment of a time-limited exemption from 
    the requirement of a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue, FFDCA 
    section 408(b)(2)(C) requires that EPA assess the available information 
    about consumption patterns among infants and children, special 
    susceptibility of infants and children to pesticide chemical residues, 
    and the cumulative effects on infants and children of the residues and 
    other substances with a common mechanism of toxicity. In addition, 
    FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(C) provides that EPA shall apply an additional 
    tenfold (10X) margin of exposure (safety) for infants and children in 
    the case of threshold effects to account for prenatal and postnatal 
    toxicity and the completeness of the database on toxicity and exposure 
    unless EPA determines that a different margin of exposure (safety) will 
    be safe for infants and children. This additional margin of exposure 
    (safety) is commonly referred to as the Food Quality Protection Act 
    Safety Factor. In applying this provision, EPA either retains the 
    default value of 10X or uses a different additional safety factor when 
    reliable data available to EPA support the choice of a different 
    factor.
        In this instance, based on all the available information, EPA 
    concludes that there are no effects of concern to infants, children, or 
    adults when Aspergillus flavus AF36 is used in accordance with the 
    crisis exemption. As a result, EPA concludes that no additional margin 
    of exposure (safety) is necessary to protect infants and children.
        Moreover, based on the data and EPA analysis presented in this 
    document, the Agency is able to conclude that there is a reasonable 
    certainty that no harm will result to the U.S. population, including 
    infants and children, from aggregate exposure to the residues of 
    Aspergillus flavus AF36 when it is used as an antifungal agent in 
    accordance with the crisis exemption. Such exposure includes all 
    anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there 
    is reliable information. As discussed previously, there is reasonable 
    certainty of no harm via dietary exposure from this fungus when used as 
    an antifungal agent because the microorganism is non-toxic and non-
    pathogenic to animals and humans. EPA arrived at this conclusion based 
    on the very low levels of mammalian toxicity for acute oral and 
    pulmonary effects with no toxicity or infectivity at the doses tested 
    (see Unit IV. of this document).
    
    VIII. Other Considerations
    
    Analytical Enforcement Methodology
    
        An analytical method is not required for enforcement purposes since 
    the Agency is establishing an exemption from the requirement of a 
    tolerance without any numerical limitation.
    
     IX. Conclusion
    
        The EPA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm 
    will result to the U.S. population, including infants and children, 
    from aggregate exposure to residues of Aspergillus flavus AF36. 
    Therefore, a time-limited exemption from the requirement of a tolerance 
    is established for residues of Aspergillus flavus AF36 in or on dried 
    figs when used in accordance with the crisis exemption. This time-
    limited exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of 
    Aspergillus flavus AF36 in or on dried figs will expire and is revoked 
    on December 31, 2017.

    XI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews
    
        This action establishes an exemption from the requirement of a 
    tolerance under FFDCA sections 408(e) and 408(l)(6). The Office of 
    Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these types of actions from 
    review under Executive Order 12866, entitled ``Regulatory Planning and 
    Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Because this action has been 
    exempted from review under Executive Order 12866, this action is not 
    subject to Executive Order 13211, entitled ``Actions Concerning 
    Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or 
    Use'' (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) or Executive Order 13045, entitled 
    ``Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety 
    Risks'' (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997). This action does not contain any 
    information collections subject to OMB approval under the Paperwork 
    Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., nor does it require any 
    special considerations under Executive Order 12898, entitled ``Federal 
    Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and 
    Low-Income Populations'' (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).
        Since tolerances and exemptions that are established in accordance 
    with FFDCA sections 408(e) and 408(l)(6), such as the exemption in this 
    final rule, do not require the issuance of a proposed rule, the 
    requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et 
    seq.) do not apply.
        This action directly regulates growers, food processors, food 
    handlers, and food retailers, not States or tribes, nor does this 
    action alter the relationships or distribution of power and 
    responsibilities established by Congress in the preemption provisions 
    of FFDCA section 408(n)(4). As such, the Agency has determined that 
    this action will not have a substantial direct effect on States or 
    tribal governments, on the relationship between the national government 
    and the States or tribal governments, or on the distribution of power 
    and responsibilities among the various levels of government or between 
    the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Thus, the Agency has 
    determined that Executive Order 13132, entitled ``Federalism'' (64 FR 
    43255, August 10, 1999) and Executive Order 13175, entitled 
    ``Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments'' (65 FR 
    67249, November 9, 2000) do not apply to this action. In addition, this 
    action does not impose any enforceable duty or contain any unfunded 
    mandate as described under Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
    (UMRA) (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.).
        This action does not involve any technical standards that would 
    require Agency consideration of voluntary consensus standards pursuant 
    to section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement 
    Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note).
    
    XII. Congressional Review Act
    
        Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), 
    EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required 
    information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and 
    the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of 
    the rule in the Federal Register. This action is not a ``major rule'' 
    as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

    pesticide pursuant to a FIFRA section 18 emergency exemption. This

    of Aspergillus flavus AF36 in or on dried figs will expire and is
