    40 CFR Part 62
    
    [EPA-R07-OAR-2015-0733; FRL-9941-06-Region 7]
    
    
    Approval and Promulgation of State Plans for Designated 
    Facilities and Pollutants; Nebraska; Sewage Sludge Incinerators
    
    AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
    
    ACTION: Direct final rule.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking direct 
    final action to approve the Clean Air Act (CAA) section 111(d)/129 
    negative declaration for the state of Nebraska, for existing sewage 
    sludge incinerator (SSI) units. This negative declaration certifies 
    that existing SSI units subject to sections 111(d) and 129 of the CAA 
    do not exist within the jurisdiction of Nebraska. EPA is accepting the 
    negative declaration in accordance with the requirements of the CAA.
    
    DATES: This direct final rule will be effective March 7, 2016, without 
    further notice, unless EPA receives adverse comment by February 5, 
    2016. If EPA receives adverse comment, we will publish a timely 
    withdrawal of the direct final rule in the Federal Register informing 
    the public that the rule will not take effect.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Throughout this document ``we,'' ``us,'' or 
    ``our'' refer to EPA. This section provides additional information by 
    addressing the following:
    
    I. Background
    II. Analysis of State Submittal
    III. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews
    
    I. Background
    
        The CAA requires that state regulatory agencies implement the 
    emission guidelines and compliance times using a state plan developed 
    under sections 111(d) and 129 of the CAA. The general provisions for 
    the submittal and approval of state plans are codified in 40 CFR part 
    60, subpart B and 40 CFR part 62, subpart A. Section 111(d) establishes 
    general requirements and procedures on state plan submittals for the 
    control of designated pollutants. Section 129 requires emission 
    guidelines to be promulgated for all categories of solid waste 
    incineration units, including SSI units. Section 129 mandates that all 
    plan requirements be at least as protective and restrictive as the 
    promulgated emission guidelines. This includes fixed final compliance 
    dates, fixed compliance schedules, and Title V permitting requirements 
    for all affected sources. Section 129 also requires that state plans be 
    submitted to EPA within one year after EPA's promulgation of the 
    emission guidelines and compliance times.
        States have options other than submitting a state plan in order to 
    fulfill their obligations under CAA sections 111(d) and 129. If a State 
    does not have any existing Sewage Sludge Incineration (SSI) units for 
    the relevant emissions guidelines, a letter can be submitted certifying 
    that no such units exist within the State (i.e., negative declaration) 
    in lieu of a state plan. The negative declaration exempts the State 
    from the requirements of subpart B that would otherwise require the 
    submittal of a CAA section 111(d)/129 plan.
        On March 21, 2011 (76 FR 15372), the EPA established emission 
    guidelines and compliance times for existing SSI units. The emission 
    guidelines and compliance times are codified at 40 CFR 60, Subpart 
    MMMM. In order to fulfill obligations under CAA sections 111(d) and 
    129, NDEQ submitted a negative declaration letter to EPA on December 6, 
    2012. The submittal of this declaration exempts NDEQ from the 
    requirement to
    
    [[Page 381]]
    
    submit a state plan for existing SSI units.
    
    II. Analysis of State Submittal
    
        In this Direct Final action, EPA is amending part 62 to reflect 
    receipt of the negative declaration letter from the NDEQ, certifying 
    that there are no existing SSI units subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart 
    MMMM, in accordance with Section 111(d) of the CAA. If a designated 
    facility (i.e., existing SSI unit) is later found within NDEQ's 
    jurisdiction after publication of this Federal Register action, then 
    the overlooked facility will become subject to the requirements of the 
    Federal plan for that designated facility, including the compliance 
    schedule. The Federal plan will no longer apply, if we subsequently 
    receive and approve the 111(d) plan from the jurisdiction with the 
    overlooked facility. EPA is publishing this direct final rule without a 
    prior proposed rule because we view this as a noncontroversial action 
    and anticipate no adverse comment. However, in the ``Proposed Rules'' 
    section of this Federal Register, we are publishing a separate document 
    that will serve as the proposed rule to approve the negative 
    declaration if adverse comments are received on this direct final rule. 
    We will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any 
    parties interested in commenting must do so at this time. For further 
    information about commenting on this rule, see the ADDRESSES section of 
    this document. If EPA receives adverse comment, we will publish a 
    timely withdrawal in the Federal Register informing the public that 
    this direct final rule will not take effect. We will address all public 
    comments in any subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule.
    
    III. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews
    
        Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), this 
    action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' and therefore is not 
    subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. For this 
    reason, this action is also not subject to Executive Order 13211, 
    ``Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy 
    Supply, Distribution, or Use'' (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001). This action 
    merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and imposes 
    no additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. 
    Accordingly, the Administrator certifies that this rule will not have a 
    significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
    under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). Because 
    this rule approves pre-existing requirements under state law and does 
    not impose any additional enforceable duty beyond that required by 
    state law, it does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
    uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded 
    Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4). This action is not 
    approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area 
    where EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has 
    jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have 
    tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on 
    tribal governments or preempt tribal law as specified by Executive 
    Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). This action also does not 
    have Federalism implications because it does not have substantial 
    direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national 
    government and the States, or on the distribution of power and 
    responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified 
    in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999). This action 
    merely approves a state rule implementing a Federal requirement, and 
    does not alter the relationship or the distribution of power and 
    responsibilities established in the Act. This rule also is not subject 
    to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997), because it 
    approves a state rule implementing a Federal standard. In reviewing 
    section 111(d)/129 plan submissions, EPA's role is to approve State 
    choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Act. In this 
    context, in the absence of a prior existing requirement for the State 
    to use voluntary consensus standards (VCS), EPA has no authority to 
    disapprove a section 111(d)/129 plan submission for failure to use VCS. 
    It would thus be inconsistent with applicable law for EPA, when it 
    reviews a section 111(d)/129 plan submission, to use VCS in place of a 
    section 111(d)/129 plan submission that otherwise satisfies the 
    provisions of the Act. Thus, the requirements of section 12(d) of the 
    National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
    note) do not apply. This rule does not impose an information collection 
    burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
    U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).
        The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., as added by the 
    Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally 
    provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating 
    the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, 
    to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the 
    United States. EPA will submit a report containing this action and 
    other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of 
    Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior 
    to publication of the rule in the Federal Register. A major rule cannot 
    take effect until 60 days after it is published in the Federal 
    Register. This action is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 
    804(2).
        Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review 
    of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for 
    the appropriate circuit by March 7, 2016. Filing a petition for 
    reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect 
    the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does 
    it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be 
    filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. 
    This action approving Nebraska's section 111(d)/129 plan revision for 
    SSI sources may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its 
    requirements. (See section 307(b)(2)).
