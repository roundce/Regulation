    Pacific Whiting
    
        Pacific whiting (Merluccius productus) is a very productive species 
    with highly variable recruitment (the biomass of fish that mature and 
    enter the fishery each year) and a relatively short life span when 
    compared to other groundfish species. Pacific whiting has the largest 
    (by volume) annual allowable harvest levels of the more than 90 
    groundfish species managed under the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery 
    Management Plan (FMP), which governs the groundfish fishery off 
    Washington, Oregon, and California. The coastwide Pacific whiting stock 
    is managed jointly by the United States (U.S.) and Canada, and mature 
    Pacific whiting are commonly available to vessels operating in U.S. 
    waters from April through December. Background on the stock assessment 
    for and the establishment of the 2015 Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for 
    Pacific whiting is provided in the final rule for the 2015 Pacific 
    whiting harvest specifications, published May 14, 2015 (80 FR 27588). 
    Pacific whiting is allocated to the Pacific Coast treaty tribes (tribal 
    fishery), and to three non-tribal commercial sectors: The catcher/
    processor cooperative (C/P Coop), the mothership cooperative (MS Coop), 
    and the Shorebased Individual Fishery Quota (IFQ) Program.
        This document announces the reapportionment of 30,000 mt of Pacific 
    whiting from the tribal allocation to the non-tribal commercial sectors 
    on September 21, 2015. Regulations at Sec.  660.131(h) contain 
    provisions that allow the Regional Administrator to reapportion Pacific 
    whiting from the tribal allocation, specified at Sec.  660.50, that 
    will not be harvested by the end of the fishing year to other sectors.
    
    Pacific Whiting Reapportionment
    
        For 2015, the Pacific Coast treaty tribes were allocated 56,888 mt 
    of Pacific whiting. The best available information through September 
    14, 2015, indicated that there had been no harvest by the tribes to 
    date, and at least 30,000 mt of the tribal allocation would not be 
    harvested by December 31, 2015. To allow for full utilization of the 
    resource, NMFS reapportioned 30,000 mt to the Shorebased IFQ Program, 
    C/P Coop and MS Coop in proportion to each sector's original allocation 
    on that date. Reapportioning this amount was expected to allow for 
    greater attainment of the TAC while not limiting tribal harvest 
    opportunities for the remainder of the year. Emails sent directly to 
    fishing businesses and individuals, and postings on the West Coast 
    Region's internet site were used to provide actual notice to the 
    affected fishers. Reapportionment was effective the same day as the 
    notice.
        After the reapportionment, the amounts of Pacific whiting available 
    for 2015 are:
         Tribal 26,888 mt;
         C/P Coop 100,873 mt;
         MS Coop 71,204 mt; and
         Shorebased IFQ Program 124,607.45 mt.
    
    Classification
    
        The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), finds that 
    good cause exists for this notification to be issued without affording 
    prior notice and opportunity for public comment pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
    553(b)(B) because such notification would be impracticable and contrary 
    to the public interest. As previously noted, actual notice of the 
    reapportionment was provided to fishers at the time of the action. 
    Prior notice and opportunity for public comment on this reapportionment 
    was impracticable because NMFS had insufficient time to provide prior 
    notice and the opportunity for public comment between the time the 
    information about the progress of the fishery needed to make this 
    determination became available and the time at which fishery 
    modifications had to be implemented in order to allow fishers access to 
    the available fish during the remainder of the fishing season. For the 
    same reasons, the AA also finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in 
    effectiveness for these actions, required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).
        These actions are authorized by Sec. Sec.  660.55 (i), 660.60(d) 
    and 660.131(h) and are exempt from review under Executive Order 12866.
