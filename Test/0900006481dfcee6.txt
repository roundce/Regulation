    SUMMARY: The Commission published in the Federal Register of October 
    29, 2015, a document concerning an (Order) establishing an 
    authorization process to enable interconnected VoIP providers that 
    choose direct access to request numbers directly from the Numbering 
    Administrators. Next, this document sets forth several conditions 
    designed to minimize number exhaust and preserve the integrity of the 
    numbering system. Finally, this document modifies Commission's rules in 
    order to permit VoIP Positioning Center (VPC) providers to obtain 
    pseudo-Automatic Number Identification (p-ANI) codes directly from the 
    Numbering Administrators for purposes of providing E911 services. These 
    relatively modest steps will have lasting, positive impacts for 
    consumers and the communications industry as we continue to undergo 
    technology transitions.
