    Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Removal of 24 CFR 280--
    Nehemiah Housing Opportunity Grants Program
    
    AGENCY: Office of the Deputy Secretary, HUD.
    
    ACTION: Final rule.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SUMMARY: Through this rule, HUD removes the regulations for its 
    Nehemiah Housing Opportunity Grants Program (NHOP). Under NHOP, HUD was 
    authorized to make grants to nonprofit organizations to be used to 
    provide loans to families purchasing homes constructed or substantially 
    renovated in accordance with a HUD-approved program. In 1990, authority 
    for NHOP was repealed by the National Affordable Housing Act. HUD 
    removed obsolete NHOP regulations in 1996 but maintained regulatory 
    provisions deemed necessary for the administration of existing NHOP 
    grants. Currently, HUD administers only one NHOP grant agreement. As a 
    result, HUD has determined that the remaining NHOP regulations are 
    unnecessary. The existing grant and loans made under NHOP will continue 
    to be governed by the regulations that existed immediately before the 
    effective date of this final rule.
    
    DATES: Effective: February 10, 2016.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    
    I. Background
    
        Established under title VI of the Housing and Community Development 
    Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242, approved February 5, 1988) (12 U.S.C. 
    17151), NHOP authorized HUD to make grants to nonprofit organizations 
    to enable them to provide loans to families purchasing homes 
    constructed or substantially rehabilitated in accordance with a HUD-
    approved program. Loans provided under NHOP were required to be secured 
    by a second mortgage on the property involved that was held by HUD but 
    that did not bear interest. On July 13, 1989 (54 FR 22248), HUD 
    published regulations implementing NHOP and codified these regulations 
    in part 280 of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
        Section 289(a) of the National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101-
    625, approved November 28, 1990) (42 U.S.C. 12839), however, repealed 
    authority for NHOP. On August 19, 1996 (61 FR 42952), HUD published a 
    final rule removing obsolete sections of 24 CFR part 280, but 
    maintained those provisions deemed necessary to the administration of 
    existing NHOP grants. As of the date of this publication, however, HUD 
    maintains one NHOP grant agreement and has 1,028 active Nehemiah loans. 
    Based on this, HUD has determined that there is no longer a need to 
    maintain 24 CFR part 280. As a result, and consistent with Executive 
    Order 13563, dated January 18, 2011, entitled ``Improving Regulations 
    and Regulatory Review,'' \1\ HUD is removing 24 CFR part 280. The 
    existing grant and loans made under NHOP will continue to be governed 
    by the regulations that existed immediately before the effective date 
    of this final rule.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        \1\ Executive Order 13563 was published in the Federal Register 
    on January 21, 2011, at 76 FR 3821 and directs that heads of Federal 
    departments and agencies review existing regulations to remove those 
    that are obsolete or no longer necessary.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        This final rule also removes a cross-reference to 24 CFR part 280 
    that is codified in HUD's Community Development Block Grant 
    regulations, 24 CFR part 570.
    
    II. Justification for Final Rulemaking
    
        HUD generally publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a 
    final rule for effect, in accordance with HUD's own regulations on 
    rulemaking in 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 provides for exceptions 
    to the general rule if the agency finds good cause to omit advance 
    notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is 
    satisfied when prior public procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or 
    contrary to the public interest. (See 24 CFR 10.1.)
        HUD finds that public notice and comment are not necessary for this 
    rulemaking because the authority to provide assistance under NHOP has 
    been repealed and assistance is no longer being provided under the 
    program. Therefore, the regulations being removed by this final rule 
    are no longer operative. For these reasons, HUD has determined that it 
    is unnecessary to delay the effectiveness of this rule in order to 
    solicit prior public comment.
    
    III. Findings and Certification
    
    Regulatory Flexibility Act
    
        The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) 
    generally requires an agency to conduct a regulatory flexibility 
    analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking 
    requirements, unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a 
    significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
    Because HUD has determined that good cause exists to issue this rule 
    without prior public comment, this rule is not subject to the 
    requirement to publish an initial or final regulatory flexibility 
    analysis under the RFA as part of such action.
    
    Unfunded Mandates Reform
    
        Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) \2\ 
    requires that an agency prepare a budgetary impact statement before 
    promulgating a rule that includes a Federal mandate that may result in 
    the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the 
    aggregate, or by the private sector of $100 million or more in any 
    1year. If a budgetary impact statement is required, section 205 of UMRA 
    also requires an agency to identify and consider a reasonable number of 
    regulatory alternatives before promulgating a rule.\3\ However, the 
    UMRA applies only to rules for which an agency publishes a general 
    notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to the Administrative Procedure 
    Act (APA).\4\ As discussed above, HUD has determined for good cause 
    that the APA does not require general notice and public comment on this 
    rule and, therefore, the UMRA does not apply to this final rule.

    Executive Order 13132, Federalism
    
        Executive Order 13132 (entitled ``Federalism'') prohibits an agency 
    from publishing any rule that has federalism implications if the rule 
    either imposes substantial direct compliance costs on State and local 
    governments and is not required by statute, or the rule preempts State 
    law, unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements 
    of section 6 of the Executive order. This final rule will not have 
    federalism
    
    [[Page 1121]]
    
    implications and would not impose substantial direct compliance costs 
    on State and local governments or preempt State law within the meaning 
    of the Executive order.
    
    Environmental Review
    
        This final rule does not direct, provide for assistance or loan and 
    mortgage insurance for, or otherwise govern or regulate real property 
    acquisition, disposition, leasing, rehabilitation, alteration, 
    demolition, or new construction or establish, revise, or provide for 
    standards for construction or construction materials, manufactured 
    housing, or occupancy. Accordingly, under 24 CFR 50.19(c)(1), this 
    final rule is categorically excluded from environmental review under 
    the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321).
