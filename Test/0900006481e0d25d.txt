    SUMMARY: We are adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all 
    Fokker Services B.V. Model F.28 Mark
    
    [[Page 1875]]
    
    1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a design 
    review, which revealed that no controlled bonding provisions are 
    present on a number of critical locations outside the fuel tank. This 
    AD requires installing additional and improved fuel system bonding 
    provisions, and revising the airplane maintenance or inspection 
    program, as applicable, by incorporating fuel airworthiness limitation 
    items and critical design configuration control limitations. We are 
    issuing this AD to prevent an ignition source in the fuel tank vapor 
    space, which could result in a fuel tank explosion and consequent loss 
    of the airplane.
    
    DATES: This AD becomes effective February 18, 2016.
        The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by 
    reference of certain publications listed in this AD as of February 18, 
    2016.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    
    Discussion
    
        We issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 CFR 
    part 39 by adding an AD that would apply to all Fokker Services B.V. 
    Model F.28 Mark 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 airplanes. The NPRM 
    published in the Federal Register on June 15, 2015 (80 FR 34106).
        The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the Technical 
    Agent for the Member States of the European Union, has issued EASA 
    Airworthiness Directive 2014-0109, dated May 8, 2014 (referred to after 
    this the Mandatory Continuing Airworthiness Information, or ``the 
    MCAI''), to correct an unsafe condition for all Fokker Services B.V. 
    Model F.28 Mark 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 airplanes. The MCAI states:
    
        Prompted by an accident * * *, the Federal Aviation 
    Administration (FAA) published Special Federal Aviation Regulation 
    (SFAR) 88 [(66 FR 223086, May 7, 2001)], and the Joint Aviation 
    Authorities (JAA) published Interim Policy INT/POL/25/12.
        The review conducted by Fokker Services on the Fokker F28 
    design, in response to these regulations, revealed that no 
    controlled bonding provisions are present on a number of critical 
    locations outside the fuel tank.
        This condition, if not corrected, could create an ignition 
    source in the fuel tank vapour space, possibly resulting in a fuel 
    tank explosions and consequent loss of the aeroplane.
        To address this potential unsafe condition, Fokker Services 
    developed a set of fuel tank bonding modifications.
        For the reasons described above, this [EASA] AD requires the 
    installation of additional and improved bonding provisions. These 
    modifications do not require opening of the fuel tank access panels.
        More information on this subject can be found in Fokker Services 
    All Operators Message AOF28.038#02.
    
    Required actions include revising the airplane maintenance or 
    inspection program, as applicable, by incorporating fuel airworthiness 
    limitation items and critical design configuration control limitations. 
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket on the Internet at <http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail>;D=FAA-2015-1982-0002.
    
    Comments
    
        We gave the public the opportunity to participate in developing 
    this AD. We received no comments on the NPRM (80 FR 34106, June 15, 
    2015) or on the determination of the cost to the public.
    
    Conclusion
    
        We reviewed the relevant data and determined that air safety and 
    the public interest require adopting this AD as proposed except for 
    minor editorial changes. We have determined that these minor changes:
         Are consistent with the intent that was proposed in the 
    NPRM (80 FR 34106, June 15, 2015) for correcting the unsafe condition; 
    and
         Do not add any additional burden upon the public than was 
    already proposed in the NPRM (80 FR 34106, June 15, 2015).
    
    Related Service Information Under 1 CFR Part 51
    
        Fokker Services B.V. has issued Fokker F28 Appendix SB SBF28-28-
    059/APP01, dated July 15, 2014, of Fokker F28 Proforma Service Bulletin 
    SBF28-28-059, Revision 1, dated July 15, 2014. The service information 
    describes procedures for the installation of additional bonding 
    provisions outside the fuel tank. This service information is 
    reasonably available because the interested parties have access to it 
    through their normal course of business or by the means identified in 
    the ADDRESSES section.
    
    Costs of Compliance
    
        We estimate that this AD affects 5 airplanes of U.S. registry.
        We also estimate that it will take about 11 work-hours per product 
    to comply with the basic requirements of this AD. The average labor 
    rate is $85 per work-hour. Required parts will cost about $140 per 
    product. Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of this AD on 
    U.S. operators to be $5,375, or $1,075 per product.
    
    Authority for This Rulemaking
    
        Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
    issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
    authority of the FAA Administrator. ``Subtitle VII: Aviation 
    Programs,'' describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's 
    authority.
        We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
    ``Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General 
    requirements.'' Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with 
    promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
    regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator 
    finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within 
    the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition 
    that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this 
    rulemaking action.
    
    Regulatory Findings
    
        We determined that this AD will not have federalism implications 
    under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct 
    effect on the States, on the relationship between the national 
    government and the States, or on the distribution of power and 
    responsibilities among the various levels of government.
        For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
        1. Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 
    12866;
    
    [[Page 1876]]
    
        2. Is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies 
    and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979);
        3. Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska; and
        4. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
    negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
    of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
